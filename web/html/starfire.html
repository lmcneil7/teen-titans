            <h1>Starfire Between the Series and the Comic</h1>
            <h3>Character Design</h3>
            <p>Similar to Beast Boy, Starfire goes by another name in the comics. In the comics, most characters call her Koriand'r, which is her real name, but she has been referred to as Starfire a couple of times. She has a few similarities between the tv series and the comics, but the creators altered her outfit to fit the younger audience of the tv series. In both, she has long hair; in the comics, it's curly, and in the tv series, it's straight. She wears a purple leotard in the comics and a purple two-piece in the tv series.</p>
            <h3>Character Background</h3>
            <p>There are more differences to Starfire's backstory than Robin's. In the comics, her parents and little brother are alive. In the tv series, her little brother doesn't make an appearance, and grief from war killed her parents. The Citadel takes her prisoner, and they bring her to Earth, where she escapes. In the comics, Starfire flees the Citadel on her own, and they follow her to Earth. The Teen Titans help her avoid them both times. Her sister has a role in both series, but they have a worse relationship in the comics.</p>
