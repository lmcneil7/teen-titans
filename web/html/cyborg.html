            <h1>Cyborg Between the Series and the Comic</h1>
            <h3>Character Design</h3>
            <p>Similar to Beast Boy, Cyborg shares little similarities with his comic version; the only thing they share in common is Cyborg's left eye is the biotic one. Also, Cyborg goes by his real name in the comics, Victor Stone. In the tv series, they focus on adding the color blue to his design, and the only human parts are his face and a small piece of his arms. In the comics, Cyborg's complete costume is white and has more human sections, including a portion of his chest. There's no scene establishing him in college, but there's a scene of him with his high school coach. Our guess that's in the 16-18 range in both the tv series and the comics. </p>
            <h3>Character Background</h3>
            <p>Cyborg's backstory isn't explored in the tv series, but in the comics, it's revealed that his father is the reason behind him becoming a cyborg. His father appears in the comics while he's never seen in the tv series. The Titans' Tower was given to them from Cyborg's father in the comics.</p>
