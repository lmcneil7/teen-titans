                   <p>Wecome to the <i>Teen Titans</i> Project! We're excited that you decided to come check us out! As stated on the homepage, our ultimate goal is to use markup to find differences between the Teen Titans tv series and comic book. Obviously since they were created by different people, there will be a lot of differences, but what we're really looking for is the major moments in which they either heavily deviate or have aspects that are near identical. For example, we know that the main characters are going to be in both, but have you ever wondered if any recurring characters from the television series show up in the comics or vice versa? What about whether or not Slade goes after Robin so frequently in the comics as he does the tv series? By the end of this project, we hope to be able to tell you anything you'd want to know and more!</p>

She was drawn to this project solely because she binge-watched the entire series of Teen Titans before she came to school her freshman year, and thought it to be fate. Now a sophomore, she is already a member of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter</a> of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a>, the International English Honor Society, and does the social media for the university's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pitt-Greensburg-Gender-and-Sexuality-Alliance-GSA-221990461189688/">Gender and Sexuality Alliance</a>.
