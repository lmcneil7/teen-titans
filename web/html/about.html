                   <p>Wecome to the <i>Teen Titans</i> Project! We're excited that you decided to come check us out! As stated on the homepage, our ultimate goal is to use markup to find differences between the Teen Titans tv series and comic book. Obviously since they were created by different people, there will be a lot of differences, but what we're really looking for is the major moments in which they either heavily deviate or have aspects that are near identical. For example, we know that the main characters are going to be in both, but have you ever wondered if any recurring characters from the television series show up in the comics or vice versa? What about whether or not Slade goes after Robin so frequently in the comics as he does the tv series? By the end of this project, we hope to be able to tell you anything you'd want to know and more!</p>
                   <p>At the moment, we focused on season 1 due to the time we had this semester. You'll see, as you get further into the site, that there are comics that aren't associated with an episode. The comics not related to an episode are more if we ever want to come back and add more to the site; we focused on Volume 1 of the New Teen Titans Comics, and if we saw any correlation to Teen Titans, the tv show, we marked it up. However, this means that there are comics that relate to different parts of the show, so feel free to check them out.</p>

                   <b>Shannon Dunn</b> is an undergraduate English Literature major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, who is also pursuing the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a>. She was drawn to this project solely because she binge-watched the entire series of Teen Titans before she came to school her freshman year, and thought it to be fate. Now a sophomore, she is already a member of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter</a> of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a>, the International English Honor Society, and does the social media for the university's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pitt-Greensburg-Gender-and-Sexuality-Alliance-GSA-221990461189688/">Gender and Sexuality Alliance</a>.

                   <b>Lauren McNeill</b> is an undergraduate Engineering major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. She plans to double major with Film Studies by transferring to the University of Pittsburgh in the Fall of 2020. She's the project leader of Teen Titans and created the idea based on seeing a sticker from her friend's laptop of Teen Titans. Most of her designs are kind of hard to implement in real life, so it was nice to see this one come to life. She's also a sophomore and the Costume Co-coordinator/Costume Assistant for the university's theater. She's a part of Delta Psi Omega, the Theatre Honor Society.
