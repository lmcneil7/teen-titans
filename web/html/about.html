                   <p>Wecome to the <i>Teen Titans</i> Project! We're excited that you decided to come check us out! As stated on the homepage, our ultimate goal is to use markup to find differences between the Teen Titans tv series and comic book. Obviously since they were created by different people, there will be a lot of differences, but what we're really looking for is the major moments in which they either heavily deviate or have aspects that are near identical. For example, we know that the main characters are going to be in both, but have you ever wondered if any recurring characters from the television series show up in the comics or vice versa? What about whether or not Slade goes after Robin so frequently in the comics as he does the tv series? By the end of this project, we hope to be able to tell you anything you'd want to know and more!</p>
                   <p>To compare the show to the comics, we took the transcripts of each episode and made metadata for the comics we read online. Our project is XML heavy due to the amount of text we had to deal with and by marking them, we were able to pull and retrieve the information that we wanted to use to compare.</p>
                   <p>At the moment, we focused on season 1 due to the time we had this semester. You'll see, as you get further into the site, that there are comics that aren't associated with an episode. The comics not related to an episode are more if we ever want to come back and add more to the site; we focused on Volume 1 of the New Teen Titans Comics, and if we saw any correlation to Teen Titans, the tv show, we marked it up. However, this means that there are comics that relate to different parts of the show, so feel free to check them out.</p>
