         <i> (Opening shot: a closed stage curtain illuminated by a spotlight. It opens, revealing
            a backdrop that depicts Titans Tower and the city proper behind it on the shore. A
            wooden Robin marionette drops into view and hangs before this scene, and the voice
            of the o.c. puppeteer speaks for it.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Robin puppet: </b>Titans! Go!
         </p>
         
         <i> (The figure leaps across the stage, the camera panning to follow, then looks back the
            way it came. It is alone.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Robin puppet: </b>Hey!
         </p>
         
         <i> (Pull back to frame the entire stage. Figures in the likenesses of the other four are
            clustered at the other end. The same person provides all five voices, taking on the
            appropriate inflection for each. While the three boys' puppets have hinged mouths,
            similar to a soldier-shaped nutcracker, the two girls' puppets do not.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Robin puppet: </b>Aren't you guys coming?
         </p>
         
         <i> (Close-up of Raven; pan to each in turn.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Raven puppet: </b>What's the point? We can't possibly
            defeat the Puppet King 
         </p>
         
         
         <p><b>Starfire puppet: </b>He is too clever and powerful, not
            to mention good-looking.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><b>Cyborg puppet: </b>Yeah. We should probably just
            surrender now.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><b>Beast Boy puppet: </b>Dude, I think we already
            have.
         </p>
         
         <i> (The green puppet gestures upward on the end of this line, and the camera pulls back
            to frame the entire group as they look that way and throw up their arms. Tilt up to
            the platform above the stage on the next line to reveal the puppeteer, a short,
            squat fellow in a military dress uniform and sash. His head is in shadow, obscuring
            a clear view of his face, but protuberant eyes and a small crown can be seen. This
            is the Puppet King  his natural voice is reminiscent of Peter Lorre.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Puppet King: </b>Bravo, bravo. But enough rehearsal.<i> (He
               drops the crosspieces to which the strings are attached.) </i>Time to start the
            show.
         </p>
         
         <i> (Close-up of the stage on the end of this; the five marionettes fall in a jumble, and
            the curtain closes. Fade to black.) </i>

            annoyed, as it keeps breaking up to reveal the operations center. The previous

            the hanging out. We never have before, and conceivably it could be fun. We might
            journey to the mall of shopping, or perform braiding maneuvers upon each other's
            hair, or...
         </p>
         
         <i> (Pull back on this last word to putRavenin frame. If she was annoyed before, she is
            now absolutely ready to explode: eyes bugging out, black flames outlining her head,
            and face set in a fierce grimace.) </i>

            provide good-natured fighting banter. Cyborg soon gets into the act as well; his
            replica swings into view to join the Three Stooges-style fracas. After a few
            seconds, pull back to frame the three Titans and Raven, who watches with obvious

            end of the latter's puzzled stare. Fade to black.) </i>

            of the following: the entrance hall, the operations center, a corner of the hall,
            the storage area, the kitchen tables, complete with the open crate that contained
            the presents. Not a soul is seen in any of these shots. After a few moments of the
            last area, a hand shoots into view, accompanied by a few wisps of straw and the
            sound of splintering wood. The camera shifts to show the hand reaching up from the
            crate, with the previous views and others shown on the operations center monitors,
            cameras for after, hours surveillance. Next, the other hand emerges, and both brace
            against the crate's edge as a shadowed figure hoists itself out. The crown on the
            overlarge head gives it away as the Puppet King  All the monitors fill with static,
            and the screen snaps to black.) </i>
         
         <i> (Snap to an overhead view ofStarfireasleep in her room. Her bed is circular, with
            pink sheets and blankets, and she is sleeping the wrong way around on top of the
            bedclothes, feet on the pillow, head hanging off the opposite edge. Her puppet lies
            nearby on a round stool. Initially, the camera frames her head near the top of the
            screen, but it soon rotates 180 degrees to bring her feet into that position.) </i>

            we see the Puppet King's outline pop up just behind her, then duck away and come up

            past this and zooms in on a set of bunk beds, the bottom one of which is festooned
            with unmade sheets and dirty clothes. A sleeping silhouette can be seen on the top
            bunk; the voice gives it away as Beast Boy and this place as his room.) </i>

            King has climbed up to the bunk, and he holds out a wooden crosspiece such as the
            ones attached to all the puppets. This one has no strings, but a green spot begins
            to glow on one of the six arms and Beast Boy is briefly surrounded with light of the
            same color. He shudders in his sleep, then relaxes, and a ghostly copy of the teen

            his plaything to his chest. The intruder's hand pops up near the camera, holding
            that crosspiece; a blue-white spot now appears on one of the arms, and the big man
            is enveloped in that color light. He jerks awake with a sharp gasp, but his head
            soon rolls to one side as a specter of himself passes from his body to the puppet.

            as she moves her hand to direct his motion; she looks upward, screams suddenly, and
            dodges a falling sandbag. A snarling Robin has gotten loose of the trap she sprang
            on him and is diving with enough speed to peel his lips back from his teeth. An
            instant after he lands on the catwalk, Cyborg  still moving under her influence,

            leaps down to her level in a bid to crush her, he misses, but the tremor from his
            landing throws her off her feet. She gets up and holds one hand straight out in
            front of herself as he approaches.) </i>

            smash her apart once and for all. Only a last-second roll to one side saves her
            life. Fetching up against the railing, she looks down at the sound of a scream from
