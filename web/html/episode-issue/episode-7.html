                  a backdrop that depicts Titans Tower and the city proper behind it on the shore. A
                  wooden 
                  <li>Robin</li> marionette drops into view and hangs before this scene, and the voice
                  of the o.c. puppeteer speaks for it.) </i>

                  appropriate inflection for each. While the three boys' puppets have hinged mouths,
                  similar to a soldier-shaped nutcracker, the two girls' puppets do not.) </i>

               <p><b>Cyborg puppet: </b>Yeah. We should probably just
                  surrender now.

                  squat fellow in a military dress uniform and sash. His head is in shadow, obscuring
                  a clear view of his face, but protuberant eyes and a small crown can be seen. This
                  is the 
                  <li>Puppet King</li>  his natural voice is reminiscent of Peter Lorre.) </i>

                     drops the crosspieces to which the strings are attached.) </i>Time to start the

            Harold Appleton is murdered. His murder is revealed to be a six-inch tall soldier
            with the help of other small minuscule dolls.

            Questor tells Beast Boy about the murder and that Steve Dayton, his step-father, has
            been missing as well. However, Beast Boy wants nothing to do with helping Dayton Industries
            and goes to his room. A different toy from the ones that we have seen tries to attack
            Beast Boy; he identifies it as a puppet. Unsure of the villain behind the puppets,
            Beast Boy decides to call in help.

            They discuss the plans of Project Promethium; Questor believes the reason the board
            members are being murdered is because someone wants to steal the project and that
            the murderer is Jordan Weir.

            Beast Boy and Robin go through the balcony only to run into someone who looks like

            Kid Flash, but she didn't tell him fast enoughas Kid Flash ends up getting shot by
            a weapon that turns him into a mind-control puppet. Starfire and Wonder Girl join
            soon after into the Titans who've been turned into puppets. Raven escapes.

            Boy find a solution to releasing the mind control: vibrational frequency. Soon, all
