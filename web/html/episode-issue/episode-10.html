                  polished wood back of the chair he is sitting in. Wrists and ankles are securely
                  bound to it;

                  across. Now the lights have fully come up to show one Titan after another also
                  clamped into chairs. They are all half-unconscious, but come around with assorted
                  groans, and each has an additional binding: red energy rings at
