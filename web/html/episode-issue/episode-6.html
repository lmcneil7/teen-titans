               <i> (Opening shot: the night sky above the buildings of Jump City. Tilt down to point
                  along a street, where a vehicle can be seen turned on its side in the distance.
                  A figure stands atop it, and a couple of Titans are facing off with him. In
                  close-up, they are seen as
                  <li>Cyborg</li>
                  <li>Starfire</li> and
                  <li>Robin</li> and the vehicle is an
                  armored car whose back doors have been broken open. Gold bullion spills out to
                  the pavement. The bearded, helmeted male figure perched on it is clad in a
                  skintight black outfit with a light bulb on the chest, and both hands glow very
                  brightly. This is
                  <li>Doctor Light</li> not to be confused with the character of the
                  same name from the Mega Man game series.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Doctor Light: </b>Your pathetic skills can't outshine
                  the brilliance of
                  <li>Doctor Light</li>
               </p>
               
               <i> (He brings his hands together; the Titans scatter as a broad beam shoots toward
                  them.
                  <li>Robin</li>leaps high and flings a birdarang at the supervillain, who jumps
                  down to avoid both it and the thrower's lunge.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Doctor Light: </b>You're fast, but I doubt you'll enjoy

               <i> (He touches the bulb on his chest, causing it to glow and emit a wide-angle blast
                  that propels
                  <li>Robin</li>over the roof of a nearby building.
                  <li>Beast Boy</li>comes around a
                  corner and charges, turning into a wolf as he runs. The robber easily ducks this
                  rush.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Doctor Light: </b>A wolf is no threat when it's blind
                  as a bat!
               </p>
               
               <i> (He throws several glowing globes at the green lupine hero. They explode in a
                  series of brilliant flashes and leave him so dazzled that he reverts to human
                  form and claps both hands to his head woozily. The next one in is
                  <li>Starfire</li> who
                  flies overhead and throws a barrage of starbolts;
                  <li>Doctor Light</li>creates a radiant
                  shield around himself to block them. He drops it after she stops firing, then
                  throws a landmine-like device into the street. Its top opens to emit a wall of
                  radiation that envelops
                  <li>Starfire</li>and blocks her in.) </i>

               <i> (He swings the axle down over his head, missing the enemy, but creating enough of
                  a tremor upon impact to throw him back a few feet.
                  <li>Doctor Light</li>concentrates his
                  energy in one hand and projects an intense beam that breaks the makeshift club
                  in half. Laughing, he creates a red projectile and directs it at
                  <li>Cyborg</li> it
                  explodes in a terrific flash and storm of dust. The view clears to show that the
                  Titan is now embedded in stone, with only his head and hands free.) </i>

               <p><b>Doctor Light: </b>Now if nobody minds, I'll be taking
                  the gold.
               </p>

               <i> (Before she can finish the incantation, a beam connects squarely with her and
                  sends her to the street. He walks up behind her as she starts to get up. The
                  brooch on her cloak now shows a raven's head in its gold frame, and it will
                  continue do so throughout this episode.) </i>

               <i> (She gets herself ready again; pan to a motorcycle at the curb. It is levitated
                  and slung at the light-wielding enemy, who easily blows it apart. He nails her
                  with another blast and drives her down the block again. Now he takes his time
                  walking up; she has her back to him.) </i>

               <i> (Cut to behind her on the end of this line. Snarling with pure rage, she swirls to
                  her feet. Her eyes are glowing red rather than the usual white when she uses her
                  powers. Pull back; she grows to an impossible height, at least three times as
                  tall as
                  <li>Doctor Light</li> and thick black tendrils shoot toward him from under her
