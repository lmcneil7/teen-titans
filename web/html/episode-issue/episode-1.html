         <i> (Opening shot: an overhead view of a prison at
            night. Smoke pours from behind the outer wall and the shattered
            front entrance, as well as from a spot on the bridge that leads to the complex.
            If these clues are not enough to indicate that something very bad is
            going on, the blaring klaxons and sirens settle the point decisively.
            Zoom in very slowly and cut to inside the
            entrance; three guards run in through it.Each has a number emblazoned on his shoulder-1, 3, 8.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Guard 1: </b>Code red! Cellblock Nine! Move out!

            and then slow to a walk, weapons at the ready.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Guard 1: </b>Main yard secure.

         <i> (Their target has already bashed a large hole through the wall of the cellblock and
            is on the way in-he threw part of the torn-out section at them. Seen from the back,
            this creature is at least ten feet tall, very
            blocky, and appears to be built entirely of concrete.We have
            just met the villainCinderblock. Laser blasts from the
            guards strike the edges of the hole he has made, while a few connect with his back
            and others fly past. He turns to them, revealing an equally blocky face with small
            red eyes. The shots are having no discernible effect on him. Voicing a grating roar,
            he raises one massive foot and stomps the ground; this produces a long fissure that
            throws debris and dust into the three guards’ faces to spoil their aim.Cut to inside the cellblock. He moves in and stops upon
            hearing the next words.) </i>

            cylindrical glass tank of liquid is suspended from the ceiling.

            himself. Even though the container gets briefly stuck and has to be yanked forcibly
