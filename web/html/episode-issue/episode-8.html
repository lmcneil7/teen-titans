         <h2 id="A0">Prologue</h2>
         <i> (Opening shot: choppy waves roiling in a violent thunderstorm at night. Riding the
            swells, a freighter sails into view toward the camera. Three crewmen struggle to
            secure a tarp over a group of several dozen 55-gallon drums; two other such
            collections have already been covered. The captain steers the steadiest course
            possible under the circumstances as waves break on the bow and the wind threatens
            to
            pull the sheeting out of the men's hands. Close-up of the drums, showing them to be
            marked with the universal symbol for radiation hazards. One tips over and rolls away
            across the deck, but a booted foot comes down to stop it.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Captain: </b>
            <i> (over the loudspeaker) </i>Watch it!<i> (Cut to him, with a microphone in his
               hand.) </i>Any of that toxic junk goes into the bay, we're all in deep
            trouble!
         </p>
         
         <i> (The ship is in Jump City Bay, then. There is a flash of lightning during this line,
            which clears to show a silhouette at the window. Close-up: it is a reptilian figure
            with glowing yellow eyes, and it lifts a long trident. Back to the deck, where the
            men are still struggling to get the waste squared away. There is an explosion from
            around the corner of the wheelhouse, followed by the walls and windows blowing out.
            When the dust clears, we are inside the ruined structure; the captain is sprawled
            on
            his back, at the feet of the intruder. This isTrident.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Captain: </b>Who...or what are you?
         </p>
         
         
         <p><b>Trident: </b>I am excellence. I am perfection. I am
            Trident
         </p>
         
         <i> (On the end of this, a flash from the weapon's points illuminates him fully, think
            of
            the Creature from the "Black Lagoon" and you have the idea. Close-up of the captain,
            who cries out and shields his eyes from a sudden flare, then pull back.Tridentis
            gone. Now a few waves spill onto the port side, carrying the creature up with them.
            He holds a large clamp with a cable attached.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Crewman: </b>Hey!
         </p>
         
         <i> (The clamp is attached to the railing, and Trident goes over the side. Pan to
            starboard, where he immediately climbs onto the deck with an identical device.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Crewman: </b>He's everywhere!
         </p>
         
         <i> (This one is also hooked on, andTridentjumps ship again. The crew barely has time
            to look toward the stern before seeing him repeating the performance there as well;
            he glares back at them and leaps back into the water. Staggering and groaning, the
            captain crosses the wheelhouse and looks out through the hole in its walls. After
            Tridentsubmerges, the cables on his clampspull taut and start to drag the ship
            down, stern first. Back to the deck.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Captain: </b>
            <i> (over the loudspeaker) </i>Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
         </p>
         
         <i> (The panicked crew makes to follow this order. Long shot of the freighter, its bow
            rising higher and higher and finally slipping beneath the waves as a life raft
            floats by, carrying the captain and crew. The last they see of their vessel is
            Trident perched triumphantly atop the prow. Close-up of his weapon's points as they
            drop below the surface, then cut to the utterly flabbergasted seafarers, trying to
            figure out how they lost their ship and a huge consignment of radioactive leftovers
            in one fell swoop. Pull back to a long shot of their rubber craft bobbing in the
            maelstrom. A final lightning strike blacks out the screen when it recedes.) </i>

            He wears a microphone headset and presses several buttons on a panel. Cut to each of
            the other Titans in time with their lines; they are similarly situated in individual
            cockpits, and through the windows around them water is flowing by. The Titans are
            in
            the T-Sub, their five-man submersible.) </i>

         <i> (The engines have finished warming up. Dissolve to an overhead view of him and pull

            ray, with the five cockpits in a cross formation. Bow: Robin Port: Starfire.
            Center: Beast Boy Starboard: Raven Stern: Cyborg The craft is on a platform that
            is descending in a water-filled shaft. Head-on view of a horizontal chute that
            connects with this passage; the platform slides down level with this, and the camera
            pulls back as floodlights in the sides switch on. Cut to Robin.) </i>

            speed and pushingRobinback into his seat. It approaches a closed hatch, which
            slides open upon approach to reveal the bottom of Jump City Bay. The vessel blasts
            out, to the sound of jubilant whooping from Cyborg and soon recedes into the blue
            depths. Dissolve to a close-up of a passing school of fish; the team chugs straight
            through them, disrupting the formation.Starfirewatches them while Beast Boy

         <i> (He turns his teeth to points and gnashes them. Close-up of a button labeled MIC;
            Cyborg reaches up to press it, and the sound cuts off, he has killed Beast Boy's
            audio. Back to the little showoff, whose teeth are still heard clicking together,
            but now much softer and muffled as if underwater; his next line sounds this way as
            well. His dental profile returns to normal.) </i>

         <i> (Cut to her cockpit. Through the transparent canopy, a gargantuan green-and-black
            creature rises into view and stops briefly, with its eye at her level, to blink at
            her before ascending again.) </i>

         <i> (He swims off, the T-Sub following, and heads toward the wreck of the freighter at
            the floor of the bay. As they move closer, he becomes a hammerhead shark. The
            unhealthy cargo that was on the deck has been entirely cleared away.) </i>

         <i> (He continues on o.c., passing a figure hidden in the murky shadows. It looks after
            him and then swims up and away. Outside, the T-Sub describes a slow circle around
            the wreck, keeping lights trained on it. Pan from here to Trident, who is standing
            by the hull; he watches for a moment and then swims along the ship's length to the
            breach. Inside,Beast Boymakes his way out toward open water, and the second figure
            ducks away from the opening just as the floodlight beam reaches it. The green shark
            goes after him; cut to a long shot of the freighter. The shadowed figure flees the
            scene asBeast Boykeeps a long tail on him.) </i>

            both, butTridentdrops into their wake to tail everyone. A blast from his weapon
            hits the starboard wing.) </i>

         <i> (Beast Boy is still back of the mystery swimmer; transforming into a barracuda, he
            puts on a burst of speed and begins to close the gap. Trident's shots pepper the
            water around the submarine; he scores a hit just off the port side of Robin's
            cockpit.) </i>

            takes in the scene; the four Titans descending far too quickly for their own good,
            Tridentbombarding the stern at will, and turns to the camera. We can see no
            features except two bright gleams for eyes. Waves of energy begin to radiate from
