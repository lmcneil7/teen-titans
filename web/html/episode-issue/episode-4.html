               <i> (Opening shot: a night sky filled with dark thunderhead clouds. Flashes of lightning
                  illuminate their contours. A bulky silhouette stands up among them and begins to
                  swing a pair of sticks against the clouds; every time it brings them down, there is
                  another strike and accompanying thunderclap. Dissolve to another patch of the sky,
                  where even more lightning crackles back and forth. A second silhouette, this one
                  much thinner and with spiky upswetpt hair, stands up and directs its hands here and
                  there. There is a new flare-up every time it does so.) </i>
               
               <i> (When the last one clears, the camera has moved to a point near the underside of the
                  clouds as the flashes continue from within. There is a huge strike, and the camera
                  pulls back to put Titans Tower in view. Inside, in the hall, 
                  <li>Beast Boy</li> has become a
                  buffalo and is straining mightily at a rubber band looped over his horns, trying to
                  catch it on a nearby hook. He succeeds and ducks away, coming up in human form with
                  a mischievous smile on his face. Now he produces a large, filled water balloon that
                  sloshes a bit in his hands, and he lets off a wicked little chuckle.) </i>

                  tries desperately to make a safe catch. Finally, he gets hold of it and turns
                  around, and the camera pans to show 
                  <li>Raven</li> behind him.) </i>

                  towel, shower cap, and slippers, standing there while the other 
                  <li>SD Titans</li> scroll
                  past and laugh at him. The balloon disappears as he finishes; now a pull string
                  hangs down from the ceiling, and he reaches for it.) </i>

                  <li>Raven</li> back up o.c. Down comes a
                  blueprint that fills most of the screen; the words "
                  <li>Beast Boy</li>" and "Insta-Lube"
                  slide in beneath it, after which "9000" drops from the lower edge and replaces them.
                  The diagram shows the rubber band, which is part of a floor-mounted slingshot, held
                  back by the hook and with the balloon loaded in. A tripwire in front of the rig runs
                  through overhead pulleys and is tied to a lever that is in turn connected to the
                  hook.) </i>
               
               <i> (The lower portion of the screen dissolves to a shot of the hall and zooms in on the
                  tripwire, and on the blueprint, a rough figure of 
                  <li>Cyborg</li> steps up and catches his
                  foot there.) </i>

                  taut, the lever moves, and the hook starts to pull away from the rubber band. Cut to
                  in front of the balloon, which is released as

                  down on either side to cover his cheeks. Both wear armbands and wrist/shin guards.
