         <i> (Opening shot: a night sky filled with dark thunderhead clouds. Flashes of lightning
            illuminate their contours. A bulky silhouette stands up among them and begins to
            swing a pair of sticks against the clouds; every time it brings them down, there is
            another strike and accompanying thunderclap. Dissolve to another patch of the sky,
            where even more lightning crackles back and forth. A second silhouette, this one
            much thinner and with spiky upswetpt hair, stands up and directs its hands here and
            there. There is a new flare-up every time it does so.) </i>
         
         <i> (When the last one clears, the camera has moved to a point near the underside of the
            clouds as the flashes continue from within. There is a huge strike, and the camera
            pulls back to put Titans Tower in view. Inside, in the hall, Beast Boy has become a
            buffalo and is straining mightily at a rubber band looped over his horns, trying to
            catch it on a nearby hook. He succeeds and ducks away, coming up in human form with
            a mischievous smile on his face. Now he produces a large, filled water balloon that
            sloshes a bit in his hands, and he lets off a wicked little chuckle.) </i>

            <i> (from o.c.) </i>What are you doing?
         </p>
         
         <i> (Surprised by her words, he lets go of the balloon and completely freaks out as he
            tries desperately to make a safe catch. Finally, he gets hold of it and turns
            around, and the camera pans to show Raven behind him.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span>Please tell me this isn't another ridiculous
            prank.

         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Okay. It's not a ridiculous prank. It's a
            brilliant one!

            how Cyborg put red dye in my shampoo and I turned brown for two days? Well, sister,
            it's payback time.
         </p>
         
         <i> (A thought balloon appears above his head as he describes the situation. It shows,
            in
            "Super Deformed" style, the hapless victim-tinted brown, holding a scrub brush, in
            towel, shower cap, and slippers, standing there while the other SD Titans scroll
            past and laugh at him. The balloon disappears as he finishes; now a pull string
            hangs down from the ceiling, and he reaches for it.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>I give you...the Beast Boy Insta-Lube
            9000!
         </p>
         
         <i> (As he says this, he pulls the string and he and Raven back up o.c. Down comes a
            blueprint that fills most of the screen; the words "Beast Boy" and "Insta-Lube"
            slide in beneath it, after which "9000" drops from the lower edge and replaces them.
            The diagram shows the rubber band, which is part of a floor-mounted slingshot, held
            back by the hook and with the balloon loaded in. A tripwire in front of the rig runs
            through overhead pulleys and is tied to a lever that is in turn connected to the
            hook.) </i>
         
         <i> (The lower portion of the screen dissolves to a shot of the hall and zooms in on the
            tripwire, and on the blueprint, a rough figure of Cyborg steps up and catches his
            foot there.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>

            lever...
         </p>
         
         <i> (Blueprint: it moves forward and pops the band loose. Lower portion: zoom in on the
            attachment point.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>

         </p>
         
         <i> (Blueprint: the balloon sails toward Cyborg in slow motion. Lower portion: Raven
            walks over to the setup, and Beast Boy pops into view with the ammo.) </i>

            huh?

         <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span>You're a genius.

         </p>
         
         <i> (A door opens o.c.; he perks up his ears to listen.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Here he comes
         </p>

         <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span>Whoa<i> (They hide around a corner.) </i>I do not
            think--

         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Shhh!
         </p>
         
         <i> (His eyes instantly go as wide as saucers upon realizing that his target is nowhere
            near ground zero, and the camera pulls back as he flips out for a moment. Cyborg is
            hunched down behind both of them.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Cyborg?! You can't be Cyborg!

         <i> (Footsteps echo out there as all three look out. Cut to a shot down the way, the
            camera positioned just behind the oil-filled balloon, then to an extreme close-up of
            the tripwire. A violet boot steps into view and catches it, the string is pulled
            taut, the lever moves, and the hook starts to pull away from the rubber band. Cut to
            in front of the balloon, which is released as Beast Boy jumps out in a frantic
            attempt to stop it.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>NOOOOOOOO!!
         </p>
         
         <i> (Audio and video both shift to slow motion as the projectile is propelled forward by
            the tension. Just as he is about to run into the camera, cut to a long shot of
            Starfire and zoom in to an extreme close-up of her face. She is so taken by surprise
            that she literally cannot see straight.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span>
            <i> (normal speed) </i>Eek!
         </p>
         
         <i> (Pull back to show the balloon right in front of her; it collides with her face,
            splattering her with the viscous contents, and knocks her onto her back. Normal
            speed: Beast Boy runs up.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Starfire!
         </p>
         
         <i> (She has propped herself up on her hands, but cannot see him due to all the oil
            covering her eyes. Cyborg and Raven come over.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="cyborg">Cyborg: </span>You okay

            bleating.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>Star! It was..<i> (Cut to her; he continues
               o.c.) </i>...you weren't supposed to...
         </p>
         
         <i> (Back to him on the end of this. He starts to say something else, but when the camera
            cuts to Cyborg and Raven, their disapproving stares stop him in his tracks for a
            moment.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>
            <i> (from o.c.) </i>I didn't..<i> (Pull back to frame him; he trails off and
               laughs.) </i>Just remember to change that oil every three thousand miles.
         </p>
         
         <i> (He tries to laugh again, but it dies on his lips. Starfire stands up and leans over
            him.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span>

         </p>
         
         <i> (Sight gag: her head grows in stages until it is many times normal size, and he
            shrinks a few notches before it. The oil disappears from her face on the last two
            words. From here, cut to a close-up of Cyborg, very worried. The sight gag has now
            ended.) </i>
         
         
         <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span>

            clouds and finally strikes the roadway. Overhead view of the blast, then cut to a
            big rig on the bridge. The driver yells in surprise and cuts his wheels sharply to
            the right, braking as he does so; the truck stops just short of the smoking, flaming
            strike point. Many cars slam on their brakes to avoid a collision, creating an
            instant traffic jam.) </i>
         
         <i> (As the smoke starts to clear, the two silhouettes seen among the clouds become
            visible within it. The last wisps evaporate to give a fully detailed view of both;
            they wear outfits that look like something like samurai armor, but without the upper
            body protection. The bulky one has blue skin and black clothing trimmed with blue,
            and he also wears a samurai-style helmet. A thundercloud is emblazoned on his chest,
            and he has long black sideburns. His thin cohort, on the other hand, has light
            yellow skin and hair, and his outfit is red and yellow, with a lightning bolt on the
            chest. A headband keeps his hair out of the way and has a guard plate stretching
            down on either side to cover his cheeks. Both wear armbands and wrist/shin guards.
            We have just met Thunder and Lightning.) </i>

         <i> (He throws the bolt upward. Cut to one of the bridge's columns, where the suspension
            cables are connected, seen from roadway level. It is struck, and sparks fly
            everywhere.) </i>

            distance to show it radiating outward. The bridge cables are jarred loose and begin
            to whipsaw back and forth. Cut to the semi, which gets a smoking lightning bolt
            traced into its side. Pan to the pair on the next line.) </i>

            different directions. The trailer gets a big hole blown through it, wiping out his
            graffiti. Starfire does a U-turn and swoops down on him with starbolts blazing; he
            jumps onto a line of stopped cars, she does likewise, and they run on these parallel

            he has to move down a bit. The next attack breaks a support cable; he grabs the
            swinging free end and is carried away an instant before Thunder obliterates that
            section of the rail. Robin is carried high into the air before the cable starts to
            descend. He times his next move carefully and hurls himself over Thunder, avoiding a

            him up. The former's tone of voice is now unmistakable.) </i>
         
         
         <p><b>Sorcerer: </b>Robin. Is that the best you can do?
         </p>
         
         <i> (There is a tremendous flash of lightning that whites out the entire screen. When it
            subsides, the view is at ground level; Robin drops into a crouch, free of the man's
            grasp. Cut to the robed figure, who has thrown up an arm to guard his face; he
            brings it down after a moment, revealing it to have been only a mask that was
            damaged in the strike. Most of the left side has fallen away, and underneath is a
            smooth expanse of red-orange metal with a narrow slit for the eye. The last
            remaining pieces come loose to fully expose that half of Slade's still-concealed
            face; the first time that any of it has been seen on camera. The colored reflection
            in that part of his silhouette, seen in "Divide and Conquer" and "Final Exam," is
            now fully explained, and he was able to recognize Robin from Gizmo's transmission at
            the end of "Final Exam.") </i>
         
         <i> (Robin gasps in shock and stares, frozen in place, and after a long moment, the
            mastermind disappears in a blast of smoke that fills the screen. The view clears to
            show a close-up of the metal disc he threw into the air to bring Fire to life. Pull
            back; Robin regards it thoughtfully, then picks it up for a very close look.) </i>

            tongue out to catch the raindrops.) </i>

            the mountain. He crosses to them. Lightning looks away, showing very clearly that he
            would rather be doing anything else right now.) </i>

               steps forward.) </i>Thank the person who taught me

         <i> (Cut to an overhead view of the six; two brothers and four Titans, and then dissolve
            to a long shot of the Tower, seen from the city proper. It is now sunrise of the
            next day, the clouds have broken, and a rainbow stretches up from the horizon behind
            the Tower. Pan a short distance to the entire team, on a ridge overlooking Jump
            City. Robin hands Slade's talisman to Cyborg so he can give it a looking over.) </i>
         
         Animation goofs: Starfire's armband appears and disappears during this final scene,
         and the black stones in her wrist guards turn red.
