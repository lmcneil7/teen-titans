                    <h1>Comparison Between the Comics (The New Teen Titans) and the 2003 TV Series (Teen Titans):</h1>
                    <h2>Character Design</h2>
                    <h3>Robin</h3>
                    <p>One of the significant differences in the characters is their age. In the tv series, it's never said how old each style is, but assumptions can be made based on their appearance that they're all teens. The theory is that Robin is 16 in the show. In the comics, there's a scene that shows Robin going to college, putting his age range at 18 and older. In the tv series, Robin is wearing pants; in the comics, Robin is wearing his signature leotard. Changes happened because the tv series was made for kids while the comics' audience was adults.The only other difference in their costume is tv-series Robin's includes a black collar to his cape.</p>
                    <h3>Raven</h3>
                    <p>Unlike Robin, Raven is the same age in the comics and the tv series: 16.  However, the creator made her the youngest in the comics while Beast Boy is the youngest in the tv series. Getting into the physical appearances of Raven, there is a lot of them. First, Raven's hair is short and purple in the tv series, but it's long and black in the comics. Raven's hair grows in a later episode of the tv series, but she cuts it. Another difference is that Raven is wearing a long blue dress in the comics; in the tv series, Raven is wearing a blue leotard. Lastly, Raven is wearing earrings in the comics that don't appear in the tv series. Something we noticed between the two is that Raven's primary color in the tv series is purple, and in the comics, it's blue. Even though they both wear blue, Raven is associated with the color purple a lot in the tv series.</p>
                    <h3>Beast Boy</h3>
                    <p>The main difference between the tv comic version and the tv series version is that they have different names. In the comics, Beast Boy goes by Changeling while in the tv series, he's Beast Boy. His real name Garfield Logan is used a lot in the comics, but in the tv series, the Teen Titans didn't find out his real name until they met the Doom Patrol in later seasons. Other than the slight similarities in his name, their character design is entirely different. In the tv series, his jumpsuit is black and purple. In the comics, his jumpsuit is red and white. His hairstyle is even different; it's short and spiky in the tv series, while boy-next-door prim and proper in the comics. As mentioned already, their ages are different. Changeling is close in age to the other Titans, making him at least 16 and older, while Beast Boy is made the youngest in Teen Titans, making him 16 or younger.</p>
                    <h3>Cyborg</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Beast Boy, Cyborg shares little similarities with his comic version; the only thing they share in common is Cyborg's left eye is the biotic one. Also, Cyborg goes by his real name in the comics, Victor Stone. In the tv series, they focus on adding the color blue to his design, and the only human parts are his face and a small piece of his arms. In the comics, Cyborg's complete costume is white and has more human sections, including a portion of his chest. There's no scene establishing him in college, but there's a scene of him with his high school coach. Our guess that's in the 16-18 range in both the tv series and the comics. </p>
                    <h3>Starfire</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Beast Boy, Starfire goes by another name in the comics. In the comics, most characters call her Koriand'r, which is her real name, but she has been referred to as Starfire a couple of times. She has a few similarities between the tv series and the comics, but the creators altered her outfit to fit the younger audience of the tv series. In both, she has long hair; in the comics, it's curly, and in the tv series, it's straight. She wears a purple leotard in the comics and a purple two-piece in the tv series.</p>
                    <h2>Character Background</h2>
                    <h3>Robin</h3>
                    <p>Robin's backstory is never really explained in detail in either the tv series or the comics. Through research, we found that they were the same in both. Robin grows up in a circus where mobsters kill his parents, and Batman takes him as an apprentice. In the comics, he's in college and lives with Batman for a short time before moving out. He's also aware of the existence of another Robin. In the tv series, Robin has already left Batman and has no association with him.</p>
                    <h3>Raven</h3>
                    <p>Raven's backstory is similar between the tv series and the comics.</p>
                    <h3>Beast Boy</h3>
                    <p>There are a couple of differences in Beast Boy's backstory from the comics and the tv series. His parents are the same in both; however, in the comics, he's adopted by Elastic Girl from Doom Patrol and Steve Dayton. The Doom Patrol are killed in the comics. The Doom Patrol don't die in the tv series and make multiple appearances. He's not adopted in the tv series either.</p>
                    <h3>Cyborg</h3>
                    <p>Cyborg's backstory isn't explored in the tv series, but in the comics, it's revealed that his father is the reason behind him becoming a cyborg. His father appears in the comics while he's never seen in the tv series. The Titans' Tower was given to them from Cyborg's father in the comics.</p>
                    <h3>Starfire</h3>
                    <p>There are more differences to Starfire's backstory than Robin's. In the comics, her parents and little brother are alive. In the tv series, her little brother doesn't make an appearance, and grief from war killed her parents. The Citadel takes her prisoner, and they bring her to Earth, where she escapes. In the comics, Starfire flees the Citadel on her own, and they follow her to Earth. The Teen Titans help her avoid them both times. Her sister has a role in both series, but they have a worse relationship in the comics.</p>
