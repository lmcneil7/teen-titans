                <h2>Mapping Decisions:</h2>
                <p>Though Teen Titans takes place in the fictional Jump City, many of the locations in the show were based on the city of San Francisco. When mapping, our team had to find coordinates in San Francisco that were in some way relevant to the story. Below, we've listed some of those locations and the choices we made when mapping.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Titans Tower</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Titans Tower, according to the <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Titans_Tower">Teen Titans Wiki</a>, has had several locations in various cities, but the TV show edition is in the San Francisco Bay Area. We chose a location off the coast of San Francisco to place it as accurately as possible!</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Jump City Bay</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Jump City Bay is based off of the San Francisco Bay, so we naturally mapped it there!</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Jump City Streets</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Many of the Titans' fights happen in the streets of Jump City, but often there isn't much description letting us know where they are exactly. Because of this, we essentially chose a random street coordinate in the proximity of the Tower and the other more frequent places in the series.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Forest</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Several episodes feature a forest that the Titans either come close to or travel through. Lauren found coordinates for a forest area in San Francisco that is next to a park, because several episodes refer to a park that is described as being next to the forest.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Slade's Lair</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Obviously, there are no secret evil lairs in San Francisco (Well...none that our team is aware of...), so for Slade's lair, Shannon found a bar called The Hideout and used those coordinates. This is one of the best examples of a time where we, lacking enough context for the <i>exact</i> location of a place, used a location that was named after something that was a reference to the story.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Chemical Plant</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>In episode 12, the Titans fight one of Slade's villains in a chemical plant. For this, Amber chose 'Chemoil Corporation' in San Francisco. It was within a relatively small radius from the other locations, and it was the only chemical plant whose listed address gave us coordinates on openStreetmap.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Amusement Park</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>In episode 10, Beast Boy and Terra go to an amusement park in Jump City late at night and ride roller coasters. This location was one of the trickier ones to find coordinates for in San Francisco. There aren't any major amusement parks in the actual city, and the ones that came close didn't have roller coasters. Because Beast Boy and Terra are shown riding a roller coaster, Amber wanted to find one that had one. The closest actual amusement park was a Six Flags, slightly outside of San Francisco in Vallejo, California. We figured this would be an applicable location because the descriptions in the episode's transcript made it seem that they weren't as close to Titans Tower as the Titans usually are, so it would be reasonable to assume they were somewhat outside of the city limits.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="location">
                <div class="loc"><h4>Ben's Diner</h4></div>
                <div class="locdesc"><p>Terra and Beast Boy, before riding roller coasters, eat at a late-night diner called 'Ben's Diner'. Just like Slade's Lair, there is no actual Ben's Diner in San Francisco. To substitute, Amber found a 24-hour diner called 'Orphan Andy's' in San Francisco. It was close enough to the rest of the locations, was one of the only ones open late at night, and described itself as serving burgers, which is close to what was described in the episode.</p></div>
                <div class="location">
                    <div class="loc"><h4>Future</h4></div>
                    <div class="locdesc"><p>In episode 1, Starfire ends up traveling into the future. Rather than marking each individual location in the future, we decided to consider the future its own location. For this, Lauren found a small island off the coast of San Francisco to consider "the future".</p></div>
