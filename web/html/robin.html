          <h1>Robin Between the Series and the Comic</h1>
          <h3>Character Design</h3>
          <p>One of the significant differences in the characters is their age. In the tv series, it's never said how old each style is, but assumptions can be made based on their appearance that they're all teens. The theory is that Robin is 16 in the show. In the comics, there's a scene that shows Robin going to college, putting his age range at 18 and older. In the tv series, Robin is wearing pants; in the comics, Robin is wearing his signature leotard. Changes happened because the tv series was made for kids while the comics' audience was adults.The only other difference in their costume is tv-series Robin's includes a black collar to his cape.</p>
          <h3>Character Background</h3>
          <p>Robin's backstory is never really explained in detail in either the tv series or the comics. Through research, we found that they were the same in both. Robin grows up in a circus where mobsters kill his parents, and Batman takes him as an apprentice. In the comics, he's in college and lives with Batman for a short time before moving out. He's also aware of the existence of another Robin. In the tv series, Robin has already left Batman and has no association with him.</p>
