            <h1>Beast Boy Between the Series and the Comic</h1>
            <h3>Character Design</h3>
            <p>The main difference between the tv comic version and the tv series version is that they have different names. In the comics, Beast Boy goes by Changeling while in the tv series, he's Beast Boy. His real name Garfield Logan is used a lot in the comics, but in the tv series, the Teen Titans didn't find out his real name until they met the Doom Patrol in later seasons. Other than the slight similarities in his name, their character design is entirely different. In the tv series, his jumpsuit is black and purple. In the comics, his jumpsuit is red and white. His hairstyle is even different; it's short and spiky in the tv series, while boy-next-door prim and proper in the comics. As mentioned already, their ages are different. Changeling is close in age to the other Titans, making him at least 16 and older, while Beast Boy is made the youngest in Teen Titans, making him 16 or younger.</p>
            <h3>Character Background</h3>
            <p>There are a couple of differences in Beast Boy's backstory from the comics and the tv series. His parents are the same in both; however, in the comics, he's adopted by Elastic Girl from Doom Patrol and Steve Dayton. The Doom Patrol are killed in the comics. The Doom Patrol don't die in the tv series and make multiple appearances. He's not adopted in the tv series either.</p>
