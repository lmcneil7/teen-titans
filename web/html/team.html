           <div class="textContain" id="Shan"><p><b>Shannon Dunn</b> is an undergraduate English Literature major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, who is also pursuing the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a>. She was drawn to this project solely because she binge-watched the entire series of Teen Titans before she came to school her freshman year, and thought it to be fate. Now a sophomore, she is already a member of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter</a> of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a>, the International English Honor Society, and does the social media for the university's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pitt-Greensburg-Gender-and-Sexuality-Alliance-GSA-221990461189688/">Gender and Sexuality Alliance</a>.</p> <img src="shannon-dunn.JPG" alt="Shannon Dunn, smiling"/></div>
        <div class="textContain" id="Lauren"><p><b>Lauren McNeill</b> is an undergraduate Engineering major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. She plans to double major with Film Studies by transferring to the University of Pittsburgh in the Fall of 2020. She's the project leader of Teen Titans and created the idea based on seeing a sticker from her friend's laptop of Teen Titans. Most of her designs are kind of hard to implement in real life, so it was nice to see this one come to life. She's also a sophomore and the Costume Co-coordinator/Costume Assistant for the university's theater. She's a part of Delta Psi Omega, the Theatre Honor Society.</p></div>
