            <h1>Raven Between the Series and the Comic</h1>
            <h3>Character Design</h3>
            <p>Unlike Robin, Raven is the same age in the comics and the tv series: 16.  However, the creator made her the youngest in the comics while Beast Boy is the youngest in the tv series. Getting into the physical appearances of Raven, there is a lot of them. First, Raven's hair is short and purple in the tv series, but it's long and black in the comics. Raven's hair grows in a later episode of the tv series, but she cuts it. Another difference is that Raven is wearing a long blue dress in the comics; in the tv series, Raven is wearing a blue leotard. Lastly, Raven is wearing earrings in the comics that don't appear in the tv series. Something we noticed between the two is that Raven's primary color in the tv series is purple, and in the comics, it's blue. Even though they both wear blue, Raven is associated with the color purple a lot in the tv series.</p>
            <h3>Character Background</h3>
            <p>Raven's backstory is similar between the tv series and the comics.</p>
