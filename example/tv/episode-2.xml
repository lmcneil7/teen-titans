            <title>PROLOGUE</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: outer space. There is a distant flash of light, from which four
                glowing objects emerge and approach the camera; pan to follow them across the
                cosmos. As they home in on Earth, three peel off while the fourth heads straight for
                the planet. A camera shift reveals it to be long and cylindrical, something like a
                missile in shape, with several trailing tentacles.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to the night sky, where a fireworks show is in full swing. Pull back to show the
                area as the waterfront; the craft’s brilliant streak descends past the display and
                below the horizon. Pan to a nearby carnival-Ferris wheel, roller coaster, games, the
                usual. Close-up of one of the wheel’s cars, which holds Robin and Starfire. She
                watches the pyrotechnics with complete awe and sighs blissfully.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Beautiful. Tell me again what they are
                called.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Fireworks.</sp>
            <sd>A few more go off.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>suddenly concerned</sd> On my home planet, such explosions would mean the
                Gordanians were attacking. You are certain Earth is not under attack?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Positive. Cotton candy?</sp>
            <sd>He holds the pink stuff out to her.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> The last time I ate a ball of cotton, it was
                white. And it did not taste very-</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> This is different.</sp>
            <sd>He pulls off a wad and pops it into his mouth; cautiously, she follows suit and
                realizes it is indeed different from the cotton ball.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Mmmm... <sd>A yelp of surprise.</sd> It
                vanished!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>chuckling</sd> Yeah. It’ll do that.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>sighing again</sd> When I first came to this planet, I did not think I would
                ever fit in. Earth was full of strange things. But now I see that-</sp>
            <sd>Big glare from fireworks.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Here comes the finale! Yes!</sp>
            <sd>In the sky, the display has turned into a fusillade of redoubled intensity.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Amazing!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Earth is full of amazing things too.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Best planet I’ve ever been to.</sp>
            <sd>The craft seen in space sweeps past the Ferris wheel and yanks Starfire from her
                seat in its tentacles; she is carried screaming into the sky.</sd>

        <act n="1">
            <title>Act 1</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the craft streaking toward the camera over the bay. The carnival is
                now in the distant background. Starfire struggles against the hold on her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Wherever you are taking me, I do not wish to
                go!</sp>
            <sd>She fires a starbolt at the tentacles’ base; the craft stops in midair, crackling
                all over with the energy of the shot, and she extricates herself and bugs out. The
                device goes after her. From here, cut to an overhead shot of the carnival game
                booths, then to a close-up of several bottles set up for the old ring-toss game. A
                ring is thrown into view, bouncing off the neck of a bottle as a near miss; the next
                one rattles down on target. Tilt up to the counter, to the sound of Beast Boy’s
                laughter. He and Cyborg have been playing.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> Boo-yah!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Sweet!</sp>
            <sd>They trade a high five. Cut to outside the booth as Beast Boy is handed his prize, a
                huge stuffed chicken. Raven leans against a post, her arms crossed and her
                expression showing her low opinion of the whole exercise.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Told you we’d win you a prize.</sp>
            <sd>He gives her the toy.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr> A giant chicken. I must be the luckiest girl in the
                world.</sp>
            <sd>Robin lands nearby, in a crouch.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>standing up</sd> Titans! Trouble!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> Where’s Starfire?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> That’s the trouble.</sp>
            <sd>He runs off; Raven tosses the chicken aside and all three follow him. Reaching the
                end of the pier, they look over the bay and see a scintillating object plummet
                straight toward the waves. It resolves into Starfire as she pulls up sharply to skim
                the surface, leaving a broad wake behind herself. The craft is hot on her tail. She
                looks back over her shoulder, gasps, and sidesteps to avoid a lashing tentacle;
                turning onto her back, she throws a couple of starbolts that hit the nose without
                effect.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> No more chasing now, please!</sp>
            <sd>A flip to face forward again, and she is off like a shot. She angles herself toward
                the pier and flies neatly through the other four Titans; the pursuer does
                likewise.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Who’s her new best friend?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Don’t know- <sd>socking fist against palm</sd> -but
                I can’t wait to meet him.</sp>
            <sd>The chase loops around the Ferris wheel and back to the pier, where Starfire stops
                just behind the rest of the team. Beast Boy is first to attack, leaping high and
                turning into an alligator to bite at the tentacles’ bases-just barely missing. Raven
                levitates a nearby hot dog cart and heaves it at the oncoming vehicle, which crashes
                right through it. As the thing races past Cyborg, he grabs the tentacles and hauls
                on them with all his strength. Ever so slowly, he is dragged forward a few feet
                before bringing the craft to a stop.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> Don’t know what you did to make this thing mad,
                Star, but it couldn’t hurt to apologize!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> I am… sorry?</sp>
            <sd>The tentacles yank themselves out of his grip. Robin whips out his staff, extends
                it, and goes on the offensive; a mighty swing reverberates against the nose and
                drives the craft back. It tumbles over the guardrails as he lands and puts the
                weapon away. Beast Boy, back in human form, looks down after it; a loud splash is
                heard from down o.c.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>bewildered</sd> So, did we just win?</sp>
            <sd>The thing crashes up through the planks at the Titans’ feet to answer that one with
                a big fat no. Robin vaults onto the nose.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Don’t see an OFF switch. Guess I’ll have to make
                one.</sp>
            <sd>Close-up of a panel; his fist flies down and smashes through it, and he pulls out a
                handful of wiring underneath. Sparks fly from the broken connections; pull back as
                he jumps free. The craft veers hopelessly out of control, rising higher and higher
                toward the stratosphere, and finally explodes in a mighty conflagration among the
                fireworks that are still going off. Robin lands next to Starfire.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Whatever that thing was, it can’t hurt you now.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> But…why did it wish to hurt me at all?</sp>
            <sd>Animation goof: In this shot, her armband is on the left side rather than the
                right.</sd>
            <sd>Dissolve to the exterior of Titans Tower, then cut to just inside the operations
                center door. Starfire, positively ecstatic, enters first while her teammates stand
                at the doorway. Pan to follow her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Come, friends. <sd>The background changes to
                    flowers and bathes her in light.</sd> I shall thank you for my rescue by
                reciting the Poem of Gratitude-all six thousand verses.</sp>
            <sd>Normal background resumes, and the camera cuts to the other four, now inside the
                operations center. This segue, to them, is as subtle as a car wreck-and their eyes
                and the accompanying sound effect reinforce the point. Pull back to put Starfire in
                view, facing them. The next voice, from o.c., catches her by surprise-young, female,
                perhaps a bit cocky, and very smooth.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Voice">Voice</spkr> I see you haven’t changed a bit.</sp>
            <sd>Cut to the speaker, a teenage girl similar in appearance to Starfire, but whose
                clothing is black rather than violet. Her hair is this same color, her eyes narrow
                and blue, and she wears metallic full-body armor beneath her clothes. In addition,
                her wrist guards and neck piece are metal-colored. This is Blackfire. She leans
                against the back of the couch, but pushes off from it on her next line.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> When we were little, I was always rescuing
                Starfire.</sp>
            <sd>Laughing, she opens her arms wide as Starfire squeals with delight and runs over to
                hug her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Sister!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>holding up a necklace with a large green gem</sd> Brought you a present.</sp>
            <sd>Starfire gasps deeply and her eyes pop at the sight of this bauble.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> A Centauri moon diamond?!? Where did you
                get-</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> On the Centauri moons, of course. <sd>She
                    fastens it around Starfire’s neck.</sd> Oh, look, it matches your eyes.</sp>
            <sd>The recipient beams for a moment, then opens her eyes wide to give the camera a full
                view. Sight gag: they have become diamonds as well, and they grow a little bigger as
                a cash register is heard going off. This ends after a moment.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> You must meet my friends!</sp>
            <sd>Blackfire is yanked across the operations center before she can say a word.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> I wish to introduce my big sister.</sp>
            <sd>Blackfire steps forward.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Blackfire. <sd>Starfire is caught out at her
                    boldness.</sd> And since Star told me all about the Titans in her transmissions,
                let me guess. <sd>She points to…</sd> Cyborg.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>holding out hand to shake</sd> Pleased to meet you, little lady.</sp>
            <sd>There is a loud grinding of metal as she takes the hand; after letting go, he finds
                his fingers to have been squeezed temporarily out of alignment.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> Little lady, big handshake. Well, all right.</sp>
            <sd>She goes on to…</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Raven. I like that gemstone on your Ajna
                chakra.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>impressed</sd> You…know about chakras?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> I got way into meditation on Altara Prime.
                    <sd>She moves on to…</sd> Beast Boy! What’s up?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Nothing but the ceiling, baby.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>laughing</sd> Good one!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>to Raven</sd> See? She thinks I’m funny.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr> Statistically, I suppose someone has to.</sp>
            <sd>This deflates him a bit. Finally Blackfire makes her way to the leader.</sd>
            <sd>Note: In yoga, chakras are points in the body at which spiritual energy is
                concentrated. There are seven, ranging from the top of the head to the base of the
                tailbone, and the Ajna chakra-centered on the forehead-is the second one down.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> And you must be Robin. <sd>She zips behind
                    him and fingers his cape.</sd> Oh, I am loving this cape. It’s positively
                luscious!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Thanks. It’s a high-density polymerized titanium,
                ten times stronger than steel.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Fascinating.</sp>
            <sd>Cut to just behind him-her perspective. He directs an appreciative glance over his
                shoulder as Starfire slides into view and gasps, completely shocked by this
                exchange. Back to him and the big sister; she has leaned in even closer.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> And this mask makes you look very
                mysterious.</sp>
            <sd>Starfire inserts herself between them.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> So, beloved sister, what brings you to
                Earth?</sp>
            <sd>Blackfire crosses to the couch.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> I was in the quadrant. Thought I’d see if
                Earthlings like to party. <sd>She hops over the back and sits.</sd> Besides, I
                needed a rest. Nearly got sucked into a black hole on the way here.</sp>
            <sd>The three boys are at the couch in an eyeblink, leaving Raven by herself at the
                kitchen counter.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Black hole?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> No way!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Cool!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Okay. I’m cruising through the Draconis
                Nebula, and-</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Sister! That nebula is full of black holes!
                You know travel there is forbidden.</sp>
            <sd>This remark is met with dead silence, except for a cricket chirping outside, and
                very funny looks from the four at the couch.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Most fun things in life are. Now be a
                sweetie and bring me one of those sodas I’ve heard so much about. <sd>turning to the
                    boys</sd> So anyway, I’m zooming over an event horizon, approaching light speed,
                when all of a sudden-</sp>
            <sd>Starfire walks toward the kitchen on the end of this. Snap to black, which resolves
                into the interior of the refrigerator as the door opens and she looks in. It is an
                under-the-counter model, the sort that might be found in a college dorm room. A can
                of soda is on the top shelf.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>disgruntled, to herself</sd> I see you have not changed either.</sp>
            <sd>She gets the soda and closes the door. The view blacks out again, then snaps to
                outer space. One by one, three bright streaks flash across the screen; tilt up
                slightly to show them approaching a large hovering vessel. Cut to a bank of four
                docking tubes inside as the three objects-duplicates of the craft Robin destroyed at
                the pier, the ones that peeled off from Earth-slide into place within them and stop.
                A light on each occupied tube goes green, but that on the empty fourth one flashes
                red. Cut to an alien crewman in a shadowy nook.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Crewman 1">Crewman 1</spkr> Our target was not located. The drones have
                failed.</sp>
            <sd>Pan slightly; a second crewman is next to him.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Crewman 2">Crewman 2</spkr> Have they?</sp>
            <sd>He looks down; cut to a control panel that shows outlines of the four craft, or
                drones. Three glow green, while the last one is red, matching the status lights on
                the docking tubes. One clawed hand reaches into view and presses the red outline,

            <sd>Cut to her, walking down the hall. She is still wearing the necklace and will
                continue to do so until further notice.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Sister? <sd>She looks around a bit.</sd>
                Sister, I seek your companionship.</sp>
            <sd>Close-up of a racing video game in progress. Two vehicles, one green and one white,
                speed along a twisting elevated track, and the green one gets out in front and
                blocks attempts by the white to pass. Cut to Cyborg and Beast Boy on the couch; they
                are playing GameStation on the window/screen, and their respective expressions tell
                right away who is winning.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> You want to pass me, but you can’t pass me. You

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Tighten the turn…jets…and nitro!</sp>
            <sd>He jumps up and does a laughing victory dance as Cyborg slumps over; a moment later,
                he is back on the couch. Starfire walks up behind them.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Tell me, have either of you seen

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Blazin’ B? She was here just a second
                ago.</sp>
            <sd>His face goes slack as Cyborg grins; back to the screen. The white vehicle hugs the
                guardrail, then knocks the green one aside and zooms on.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd> Aw, yeah! Back in the lead!</sp>

                <sd>deflated</sd> I see.</sp>
            <sd>She walks away. Cut to a close-up of a door; she reaches into view and knocks. It
                slides open a small amount and reveals Raven peering out-this is her room.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Is…my sister in there?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr> No.</sp>
            <sd>She starts to close the door; cut to her side. The lights are out.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Oh…Might you wish to hang out with me? We
                could visit your favorite depressing cafe.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr> Already been. It was open mic and Blackfire wanted
                to share. Your sister’s poetry is surprisingly dark.</sp>
            <sd>She closes the door; Starfire heads off down the hall and sighs heavily. Through the
                open door to the gym, the shadows of Blackfire and Robin can be seen on the wall.
                They are close enough to touch, and they do so on the next line.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>

                <sd>from inside gym</sd> Hold me just like that, and…</sp>
            <sd>Cut to the gym. She throws him the full width of the room; he spins in the air a bit
                before coming down on top of a rack of dumbbells. Starfire is positively aghast at
                the sight. Inside again; when Robin peels himself up from the floor, he is seen to
                be badly dazed from the impact.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Learned that move from a Ven-Zo master on

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Not at all. Blackfire was just showing me some alien
                martial arts. How come you never taught me these cool moves?</sp>
            <sd>Cut to a close-up of Starfire, who has no good answer, then back to Blackfire and
                Robin on the start of the next line.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Probably because she doesn’t know them. I

            <sd>The little sister stares bug-eyed after them for a moment and then hangs her head
                sadly. Dissolve to the exterior of the Tower. Inside, all the Titans except Starfire
                are lounging on the couch in the operations center; Raven is reading a book.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Perhaps a double feature?</sp>
            <sd>Sight gag: a little drop of nervous sweat springs from her head and falls.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>

            <sd>She turns to look; cut to the side door and tilt up from ground level. Blackfire
                stands there, dressed in one of Starfire’s spare outfits, and has dispensed with the
                armor.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> I am a party animal.</sp>

            <sd>Robin and Raven pass Starfire without saying anything; Blackfire is the last one
                out.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Hey, sweetie, raided your closet. Hope you

            <sd>Big sister departs, leaving little sister standing among the snacks and movies she
                dropped-the scattered remains of her plan to spend time with the gang. Fade to

            <title>Act 2</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the exterior f the creepy run-down warehouse Blackfire mentioned It is
                nighttime. A thumping dance beat can be heard within as multicolored lights pulse at
                the windows. Cut to inside and pan across the space, which is packed with partying
                teens, then pull back to an overhead view. Blackfire makes her way among the crowd,
                with all Titans except Starfire close behind. Beast Boy has returned to human
                form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Step aside, Earthlings, the queen of the
                galaxy has arrived!</sp>

            <sd>Raven looks back the way they came and sees Starfire standing at a distance now. The
                fifth Titan moves hesitantly through the dancers and gets jostled back and
                forth.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Oh…excuse…oh…uh… <sd>Her foot is trod on.</sd>
                Ow! You really should apologize after stepping on someone’s foot.</sp>

            <sd>Raven shakes her head-"this is a lost cause"-and moves further into the crowd. Cut
                to Blackfire, already getting down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>laughing</sd> Now don’t tell me you big tough superheroes are afraid of a little
                dancing.</sp>
            <sd>Cut to Beast Boy and Cyborg.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Betcha Cyborg can do the Robot.</sp>

            <sd>He does a little bit of that old dance and gets a very unappreciative glare from the
                big bionic man standing next to him. Blackfire dances across the screen in front of
                the pair, after which they and Robin start to get into the spirit of things. Raven
                and Starfire watch, the former with the same posture and expression she wore at the
                carnival game booths.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr> This party is pointless.</sp>
            <sd>A goth-looking boy comes up next to her.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Goth boy">Goth boy</spkr> Everything’s pointless. Wanna go talk about
                it?</sp>

            <sd>She looks sidewise at him and shrugs, and both walk away to leave Starfire by
                herself. She makes as if to follow them but does not. A couple of slacker types pass
                behind her and back up for a closer look after moving o.c.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slacker">Slacker</spkr> Hey, hot alien girl. You digging the scene?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>nervously, blushing</sd> I…did not know we were supposed to bring shovels.</sp>

            <sd>Sight gag: she appears in "Super Deformed" style, mortified under a solitary
                spotlight, as the two slackers laugh themselves silly and the merriment of everyone
                else is heard from o.c. Snap to black.</sd>

            <sd>Fade in to a view of Earth from outer space. The ship that launched those four
                probes drifts slowly into view; inside, the two crewmen are still watching the
                planet on the main viewer.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Crewman 2">Crewman 2</spkr> The girl may have defeated one probe-
                    <sd>Cut to the three docked drone, or probes; he continues o.c.</sd> -but she
                will not fare so well against three.</sp>

            <sd>They are launched, one by one, and when the camera cuts to outer space again, they
                rocket toward Earth. Cut to the night sky and tilt down to the roof of the warehouse
                as the three bright trails disappear into the Jump City skyline. Starfire sits on a
                ledge, head in hands. Close-up: she is utterly dejected, and she heaves a sigh.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Perhaps I do not belong here after all.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd> Of course you don’t.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to him, holding open the door at the top of the stairs that lead up to the
                roof.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> You belong down there, having fun with the rest of

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>with a false smile</sd> Nothing is wrong. Everything is wonderful. <sd>He sits
                    by her.</sd> The pounding music and blinding lights are quite enjoyable.</sp>

            <sd>The words are barely out of her mouth before her real mood rearranges her face.
                Robin looks on with concern.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Everything is not wonderful. I am happy to see
                her, but Blackfire rules the video games, and she is able to share very depressing
                poems, and she knows the cool moves- <sd>Cut to Robin; she continues o.c.</sd> -and
                she always knows when people are not talking about shovels. <sd>Pull back to frame
                    both; she sighs.</sd> And I am nothing like her.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>putting a hand on her shoulder</sd> No, you’re not. And I think-</sp>

            <sd>They are interrupted by a creak of hinges. Cut to the skylights, one of which
                Blackfire has opened to let herself out. She holds it propped open; her hair is now
                shorter and bright pink.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> How do I look? </sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Pink. Look, can you give us a minute here?</sp>

            <sd>This response is not quite what she expected. However, her demeanor changes in an
                instant with the music.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>gasping happily</sd> Oh, I love this song!</sp>

            <sd>She flies over, grabs Robin’s arm, and yanks him down through the skylight. It
                swings shut to leave Starfire alone on the roof again. She sighs wearily and stands
                up from the ledge as the sound of something in flight is heard from o.c.; now she
                looks up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Huh?</sp>

            <sd>From between the letters of the lighted sign on the roof, a glare can be seen fading
                away. Its source, one of the three launched probes, pokes out and charges at her. A
                shocked gasp escapes her before the camera cuts back to the party. Beast Boy and
                Cyborg are dancing to beat the band now, but the little green goofball stops short
                and looks up. His perspective: Starfire and the probe, visible only as silhouettes,
                are fighting it out on the skylight panes. It finally seizes her in its tentacles
                and darts away.</sd>

            <sd>Floor level; Beast Boy runs across the room to track the alien craft. Losing sight
                of it near the wall, he turns back to call in a little help.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Cy! Star’s in trouble!</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg stops dancing and turns to look, just as Beast Boy is grabbed by the
                tentacles of a second probe and dragged toward the door.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Whoa! Help!</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg runs after him, but is broadsided by the third probe; he fetches up against
                the wall, and the craft closes in. From here, cut to Raven and the goth teen she
                followed away from the dance floor. They are in a dark corner of the warehouse.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Goth boy">Goth boy</spkr> So, do you like show tunes?</sp>

            <sd>The probe hauling Beast Boy passes before she can answer. Her companion beats feet
                out of there, and she flies to lend a hand. Two crates are promptly levitated and
                projected at the craft; their impact jars Beast Boy out of its grip, and he falls to
                skid across the floor. Through the skylight, Raven spots the one that has caught
                Starfire-it gains altitude and then goes into a screaming dive to crash through the
                glass and into a pile of crates. She moves back to avoid the impact. Cyborg lands a
                punch against the probe that struck him, after which Starfire and the one that
                seized her break out of the crates. She blasts it back with a starbolt.</sd>

            <sd>Beast Boy, momentarily in the clear, suddenly yelps and jumps back a bit to get out
                of the way of the one that tried to tow him in. Transforming into a tiger during his
                backflip, he lunges at the alien craft and drives it across the room with a swipe of
                his paw. It stops beneath Starfire; in no time, it and the other two have closed in
                on her. She gasps and flies around and around to shake them, finally getting a
                breather thanks to Cyborg’s flying tackle that brings down all of them. Looking down
                as his grunts rise to her, she sees him taking on the three craft. One is punched
                away, another slung out by its tentacles; the third, however, spins like a
                high-speed flail and sends him tumbling.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to Robin and Blackfire on the stairs. His attention drawn by the commotion on
                the other side of the wall, he turns toward it as Blackfire tries to pull him
                away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Where are you going? Stay and talk to
                me.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Look, I just want to make sure that Starfire’s
                okay.</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg comes crashing through the wall. As he stands up, rubbing his head and
                grumbling, Robin runs over to him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> What’s going on?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> Remember that thing that attacked Star? It had
                friends.</sp>

            <sd>He rushes back into the melee, leaving Blackfire alone at the top of the stairs.
                Robin starts to follow, but stops upon seeing her there.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Didn’t you hear him? Your sister needs help!</sp>
            <sd>Pause.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>smiling</sd> Right. Of course.</sp>

            <sd>She pulls off her pink hair and drops it-it is only a wig she had been wearing over
                her natural hair. Now she runs down the stairs. Cut to the alley behind the
                warehouse; Starfire crashes out through the wall, hits the one opposite, and drops
                into a nearby Dumpster. The three probes float out as she opens the lid for a peek.
                One of them slams it down on her head and starts to hoist the entire container
                skyward; her screams are heard from inside as all three take off.</sd>

            <sd>Robin’s birdarang flashes into view and severs two of the tentacles holding the
                Dumpster, causing it to fall to the ground. It returns to his hand; pull back to
                frame all the Titans except Starfire. Beast Boy is back in human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin, Cyborg">Robin, Cyborg</spkr> Teen Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>Before they can move, Blackfire flies over their heads and straight toward the three
                probes, which move to intercept. Beams of energy shoot forth from her eyes and blow
                them all away; fragments of hulls and tentacles rain down as she lands in the
                alley.</sd>

                <sd>from o.c.</sd> Aw, yeah! <sd>Pan slightly, the four Titans run/fly to her.</sd>

                the team.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Me? A Teen Titan?</sp>

            <sd>The Dumpster lid swings open, and Starfire pokes her head up and gasps in undiluted
                shock. A banana peel has fallen on her head. Fade to black.</sd>

            <title>Act 3</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: an overhead view of the Tower. It is later that night, and waves break
                loudly against the island’s shores. Cut to the roof; Starfire walks slowly to the
                edge, away from the camera, to silhouette herself against the full moon. She carries
                a backpack by the shoulder straps. Close-up as she looks back-her face tells the
                story: she is ready to throw in the towel once and for all.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>slinging up pack</sd> She will be a better Titan than I ever was.</sp>

            <sd>She lifts off from the roof. Pull back; Robin steps out, and his words stop her from
                heading into the great wide open.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Were you just going to leave without saying
                goodbye?</sp>

            <sd>Having been called out in this manner, she cannot look him in the eye, but instead
                dips her head and descends back to the roof, her knees half-buckled. The backpack
                slides from her shoulders; finally she looks up at him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Robin, I-</sp>

            <sd>The sound of an approaching craft draws a gasp from her and an over-shoulder look
                from him. Pull back to put it in view: the same ship that launched the four probes
                in the first place. One of the two crewmen is standing on its flat top deck. It
                turns 90 degrees to present one side to the Titans, and the standing man lashes out
                a long tentacle from his right arm that pushes Robin back and then snares Starfire.
                The left arm has the claws seen earlier aboard ship. The tentacle’s end wraps itself
                around her mouth before she can put up any sort of resistance, and the ship begins
                to haul her away.</sd>

            <sd>Robin gets to his feet and sprints most of the length of the roof, finally leaping
                over the edge toward the alien vessel. Slowly but surely, his momentum carries him
                closer to Starfire; extreme close-up of one of her feet, with his hand straining
                toward it. The effort falls short, however, and she is lifted toward outer space as
                her muffled cries ring in the air.</sd>

            <sd>Dissolve to the moon, now partially obscured by drifting clouds. The ship flies into
                view; now the other crewman is on the top deck, handling the navigational duties. A
                cut to a control button at deck level shows an arm reaching down to it and
                Starfire’s feet just in front of him. Pull back as the button is pressed; a force
                field appears around the still-bound girl.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Crewman 1">Crewman 1</spkr> Prepare to leave Earth orbit. We have the
                Tamaranean girl.</sp>

                <sd>to Starfire</sd> Once we return to Centauri, you will pay for what you have
                done.</sp>

            <sd>Now we know what race these creatures are. She can only struggle and grunt through
                her bonds. Pull back to a side view of the ship and pan/tilt down to its underside.
                Robin is hanging on upside down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Nobody’s taking her away.</sp>

            <sd>He vaults to the deck and lands facing the crewman at the force-field holding
                cell.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> My friend stays here!</sp>

            <sd>The Centauri roars and charges at him with a swing of that right arm, but he easily
                dodges this. A roundhouse also misses the Boy Wonder; the alien’s next attack
                consists of a series of right-handed laser blasts-the thing on his arm is a
                multi-purpose weapon. Robin leaps away from the shots, several of which hit the
                force field holding Starfire and bounce off, and the Centauri charges toward him. An
                overhead swing crackles upon impact with the field and leaves his underarm exposed
                for Robin’s counter-punch. This blow sends sparks up from the armor and pushes the
                aggressor back a bit.</sd>

            <sd>Now the young man retreats to a spot near one of the ship’s engines, on the side.
                Out comes that tentacle, which he barely dodges; it hits the edge of his cape and
                deflects into the engine, causing it to flame out.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Centauri 1">Centauri 1</spkr> No!</sp>

            <sd>The craft begins to lose altitude, throwing his colleague off balance and putting
                the brawl on hold for the time being. It plunges through the clouds and just barely
                skims a riverbank.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Centauri 1">Centauri 1</spkr> I cannot control it!</sp>

            <sd>Robin scrambles across the deck to the control button and deactivates the force
                field. The ship descends ever closer to the river as he peels the tentacles away
                from her body.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Robin!</sp>
            <sd>Cut to a point between them.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd> Come on!</sp>

            <sd>They reach into view and join hands; pull back as they leap from the deck. The ship
                turns down nose first and grinds into the riverbank, skidding a considerable
                distance before finally stopping and tumbling forward to land on its top deck.
                Starfire lowers Robin safely to the ground and lands beside him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd> Star! Robin!</sp>
            <sd>He, Cyborg, and Raven run up.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr> You guys okay?</sp>

            <sd>The two Centauri crewmen stand up amid the clouds of smoke pouring up from their
                wrecked craft. All five Titans brace for action.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Titans! Get ready!</sp>

                you are all under arrest.</sp>

            <sd>He shows a badge, the sight of which leaves the entire team momentarily
                stunned.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Uh…you can’t be the good guys. We’re the
                good guys.</sp>
            <sd>Close-up of the two.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Centauri 2">Centauri 2</spkr> And we are Centauri police.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Centauri 1">Centauri 1</spkr> The Tamaranean girl is a liar and a thief.
                    <sd>pointing</sd> She’s committed high crimes throughout the entire Centauri
                system.</sp>

            <sd>On the end of this, cut to Robin and Starfire; she is on the receiving end of the
                gesture.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> I have never even been to the Centauri
                moons!</sp>
            <sd>She and Robin both look at her necklace.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>removing it, holding it up</sd> But I know someone who has.</sp>

            <sd>Gazing into the large green gem her sister gave to her, Starfire gasps as the pieces
                of the frame-up fall together in her brain. Pull back; Robin turns to address the
                o.c. Centauri cops.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> You’ve been chasing the wrong girl. <sd>He throws
                    the necklace away and turns to the team.</sd> Where’s Blackfire?</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy is the first to provide an answer, pointing up at a tiny black shape
                zooming among the clouds and away from the area.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Beast Boy">Beast Boy</spkr> Uh…</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Don’t worry, Star. She won’t get away with
                this.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>with sudden ice-cold fury</sd> No, she will not!</sp>

            <sd>She takes off. Cut to a long shot of her sister, headed toward space; she has
                changed back into her own clothes and put the armored undergarment back on. Starfire
                flies up to intercept.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Hello, sister.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Aww, you’re mad. I know, I should have told
                you I was leaving, but you know how I hate goodbyes and-</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> You are a criminal, and you were going to let
                me take your place in jail!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Oh…well…yeah.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>leaning into her face</sd> You will give back what you have stolen and turn
                yourself over to the police!</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr>
                <sd>leaning right back</sd> And what will you do if I don’t?</sp>

            <sd>Starfire has no immediate answer here. Blackfire warms up a starbolt and lets her
                have it in the kisser to send her tumbling.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> I always was the better fighter.</sp>

            <sd>Her little sister rights herself after touching down on the ground and floats back
                up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Not anymore!</sp>

            <sd>Blackfire unloads a machine-gun barrage of starbolts; Starfire flies through them
                all without so much as getting her hair singed and gathers herself for a crushing
                counterstrike. This shot connects with Blackfire’s hand and makes the one she was
                about to throw fizzle out. One very angry little sister rises to stare her down;
                both hands are lost in the dazzling radiance of the starbolts she is holding in
                check. Blackfire merely laughs in her face, but trails off into surprised yells as a
                Centauri tentacle whips in from behind to tie her up. Starfire turns to look toward
                the source; cut to him, standing on the deck of the righted ship.</sd>

            <sd>Animation goof: The armor on Blackfire’s legs disappears briefly during this
                sequence.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Centauri 2">Centauri 2</spkr> Blackfire of Tamaran, you are under
                arrest.</sp>
            <sd>Back to the two girls; she is slowly reeled in.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>waving</sd> Farewell, sister! Although you did betray and attack me, it
                was…still very nice to see you.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Blackfire">Blackfire</spkr> Next time it won’t be so nice. I will get
                out of jail, little sister, and I will get even!</sp>

            <sd>Said little sister looks down at her worriedly. Dissolve to the roof of the Tower;
                it is now sunrise of the next day. Starfire sits at the edge, bathed in light and
                lost in thought, and looks out over the sparkling bay as the wind blows her hair
                where it will. Robin comes up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> Hey. How are you doing?</sp>
            <sd>He sits by her.</sd>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> I am…sad for my sister.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> And for yourself?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> I am just glad that the truth was discovered
                before I was replaced.</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr> What are you talking about?</sp>
            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr> Well, you…everyone was having such fun with

                never take your place. <sd>smiling</sd> No one could ever take your place.</sp>

            <sd>Her answering smile shows that she has heard him loud and clear. Cut to a long shot
                of them from behind-two seated silhouettes watching the sun come up, their long
                shadows stretching back across the roof. Fade to black.</sd>
