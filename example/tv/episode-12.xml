            <title>Prologue</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: a pure white field, which resolves into Robin's eye as the camera
                pulls back to frame him running flat out. Pull back again; he is chasing Slade
                across a rocky landscape under the starry night sky. Pan across the area as the
                masked villain leaps across a deep crevasse, then to a rock formation that
                completely blocks the view. When the camera passes the far edge, it has moved to a
                close-up of the two runners. With Robin still close behind him, Slade bounds over
                another fissure and drops over the edge of a mesa before making a beeline for a
                high, flat peninsula studded with several tower-like formations. There is a narrow
                path leading to it, but he forgoes this in favor of a single long, high jump. Robin
                does likewise, landing in a crouch, and comes up for a wary look around. Slade steps
                out from behind a rock.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Dangerous behavior, Robin. You must be very eager to
                see me. I'm flattered.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I'm not here to see you. I'm here to stop you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>stepping closer; they circle</sd>Hmm. But how can you stop me, when you don't
                even know what I'm planning?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Like this.</sp>

            <sd>He rushes in with a savage kick; Slade dodges easily, and the follow-up punch only
                smashes a chunk from one of the towers. The two spare a bit, after which Robin finds
                himself on the defensive and tries a charging punch. Slade catches his fist and
                hurls him against a tower, but Robin rebounds quickly and tries a punch that
                pulverizes more rock. One strike after another misses its mark but sends up clouds
                of stone dust. Slade's eye glows briefly during this string of attacks; at the end
                of it, he lands a powerful kick that staggers the Titan very badly. He is soon on
                his feet and fighting back, but his punches are blocked and he takes one that bowls
                him over again.</sd>

            <sd>When he gets up this time, he has a birdarang in each hand and lets them fly. Slade
                stands his ground, arms crossed in front of himself; there is a quick flash and
                clang of metal on metal, and we see each weapon in turn smash into a tower. The
                formations begin to crumble, and the camera pulls back to an overhead view to show
                them all toppling in a cloud of dust that covers the entire area. Close-up; Robin's
                silhouette appears within the haze, and he steps into the open to survey the place.
                His eyes pop when he looks off to his right; the dust clears as he sidles off that
                way.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Excellent, Robin.<sd>passing crumbled formations behind him</sd>
                We appear to be evenly matched and equally ruthless.</sp>

            <sd>Back to Robin, now easing around within the dust, on the end of this.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>off-screen</sd>Not surprising. You and I are so very much alike.</sp>

            <sd>As he finishes this line, the dust clears to show him standing behind Robin; the
                latter whirls to face him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I'm nothing like you!</sp>

            <sd>He throws an uppercut that connects squarely with the metal-covered jaw and sends
                Slade crashing to the ground.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>pulling him up</sd>You're a criminal, a psychopath! All you care about is
                destruction!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>And all you care about, you destroy.</sp>

            <sd>He gestures off to one side; Robin looks in that direction and sees the shattered
                debris left from the brawl. The base of one smashed pinnacle is shaped like Cyborg's
                head, and as the camera pans across the rest of the rubble, broken likenesses of the
                other three Titans are seen.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>horrified</sd>No!<sd>to Slade</sd>Who are you?!</sp>

            <sd>He reaches toward the face. Cut to an empty patch of sky; the mask is flung up and
                away, and the camera cuts to a close-up of him and zooms in. He is staring in
                bug-eyed shock, and a shift to just behind him shows why the face behind that smooth
                expanse of steel is his own. The duplicate laughs heartily in Slade's voice as the
                camera dissolves to a long overhead shot of the ruined peninsula and pulls back
                slowly.</sd>

            <sd>A flash of white, and we are in Robin's room. He is asleep at his worktable, but
                sits bolt upright with a gasp of terror-the entire proceedings up to this point were
                his very bad dream. His face runs with sweat as he tries to catch his breath. The
                door is heard opening.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>It's him.<sd>Pan to the door; he is there.</sd>It's Slade.</sp>

            <sd>Snap to black.</sd>

            <cue>OPENING THEME</cue>

        </act>
        <act n="1">
            <title>Act One</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the operations center. It is just before daybreak. The Titans are
                gathered before the window/screen, which shows Slade's face. He is in some sort of
                industrial area.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Good morning, Teen Titans.<sd>Cut to Robin, Starfire,
                    and Cyborg; he is heard on speaker.</sd>I do hope I didn't wake you.</sp>

            <sd>Pan to Raven and Beast Boy.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>yawning</sd>What are you, an insomniac? Who calls at five in the morning--?</sp>

            <sd>Raven elbows him in the side to cut him off.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>What do you want?</sp>

            <sd>The scene cuts to the screen again</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Well, that's precisely what you've been trying to
                find out, isn't it? And in spite of all your efforts, you're still in the dark about
                my intentions.<sd>Close-up of Robin; he is heard on speaker.</sd>Disappointing,
                Robin. I expected a little more from you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Like I care what you--</sp>

            <sd>The scene cuts to the screen again</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>But since you've been unable to discover my plan, I
                suppose I'll just have to reveal it myself.</sp>

            <sd>Pan away from him on the end of this line. Two of his commando robots are standing
                next to a large object covered with a tarp.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>I'm sure you're all familiar with the concept of a Chronoton
                Detonator.</sp>

            <sd>The tarp is pulled away as he says this. Underneath it is a large, egg-like piece of
                machinery with a couple of red lights set into its surface. The upper portion
                telescopes toward the ceiling, giving a view of the circuitry inside and more sets
                of lights. Cut to Robin and Cyborg, then pan to each of the others in turn during
                the next two lines.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No!</sp>

            <sd>Starfire gasps.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Uh-oh.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>No way!<sd>Pull back; he turns to
                    Starfire.</sd>Um, what's a crouton detonator?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>It eradicates all chronotons within a localized
                area, utterly destroying the temporal component of the space-time continuum.</sp>

            <sd>A question mark pops up by his head.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Hmm?</sp>

            <sd>Pan to Raven.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>It stops time. Permanently.</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy cries out and faints.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>If he triggers that thing downtown, it'll
                freeze-frame the entire city.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>to Slade on the screen</sd>Tell me where!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>You're a clever boy, Robin.<sd>Cut to Robin; he is
                    heard on speaker.</sd>I'm sure you and your little friends can figure it
                    out.<sd>The screen again; he holds up a transmitter.</sd>However, since I
                control the detonation, time is not on your side.</sp>

            <sd>The screen fills with static, and Robin slams a fist down on the computer keyboard
                with a frustrated grunt. Now the window has cleared.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Fan out! Find it! Shut it down!</sp>

            <sd>He storms toward the door, but Beast Boy and Cyborg move to block his path.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>tugging his collar</sd>Hey, uh, maybe you should stay here and coordinate the
                search.</sp>

            <sd>A big drop of sweat rolls down his temple on the end of this; cut to Robin.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>What?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Man, when it comes to Slade, you've got issues.</sp>

            <sd>Shift to frame all three boys on the end of the line; Cyborg has pointed a finger at
                Robin's temple and is twirling it in the classic "this guy has a screw loose"
                gesture.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Might be better for the team if you sit this one
                out.</sp>

            <sd>Back to Robin on the end of this.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>No.</sp>

            <sd>Letterbox, top third of screen; the three and Starfire appear as silhouettes.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>heading out</sd>There's too much at stake for me to--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Robin...</sp>

            <sd>He stops at her mention of his name. Fullscreen, normal view.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>We have not forgotten the last time you
                faced--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I made a mistake, Starfire. It won't happen
                    again.<sd>heads out again</sd>I can handle it. I promise.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.; the computer is heard</sd>Would you at least like to know where to
                look?</sp>

            <sd>Everyone turns to look at her. She is at the keyboard, and the camera tilts up to
                show a freeze frame from Slade's message, the robots and the detonator, on the
                window/screen.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Slade gave us more information than he realized.</sp>

            <sd>The image fills the screen. Zoom in on a patch of it as a set of gridlines is
                superimposed; a small blurry image on the metal surface stands out.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.; zoom in closer</sd>Here, in this reflection.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to her and Beast Boy.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Ooh, squiggly lines. Way informative.</sp>

            <sd>Back to the image. As more keystrokes are heard, it refines and can be clearly seen
                as backward text: "PIER 41." This is turned around to read normally. Cut to
                Starfire.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Pier Forty-One!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>stepping closer</sd>The docks!</sp>

            <sd>Raven glares at her detractor, who grins and chuckles nervously at having been shown
                up. Dissolve to a sign marking that location and pan to one of the warehouses at the
                waterfront. It is now closer to sunup. Robin runs to the doors, followed by Beast
                Boy, as a cheetah, returning to human form, and then the rest of the group. Cyborg
                whips out his sonic cannon and lets it speak; cut to inside. The doors are blasted
                away, and Robin dashes in with his fighting staff in hand. He extends it to as the
                others follow him, ready to slug it out. Their perspective, panning across the
                interior-no detonator, no Slade, no commandos, no nothing.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Empty?</sp>

            <sd>Overhead view of them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Oh, man!</sp>

            <sd>Ground level.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I don't believe this!</sp>

            <sd>To add injury to insult, those robotic strongmen show up out of nowhere, standing on
                the overhead beams as well as all over the floor. A few even move to block the
                exit.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Great. Now what do we do?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>We fight.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back from the group, then dissolve to a longer shot and keep pulling back to
                show just how badly outnumbered our heroes really are. The opposing forces start to
                close in.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>They do so. He moves so fast that he almost seems to be everywhere at once, knocking
                out one robot after another before they have time to react. A couple back up before
                Cyborg's headlong dash; he gets ready to deliver a real haymaker, but Robin moves in
                first and dispatches them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Hey! I was gonna do that!</sp>

            <sd>Elsewhere, Starfire skids backward a bit and is quickly surrounded by the metallic
                musclemen. She warms up her starbolts and rises into the air to do a spinning
                strafe, but again Robin zips in and wipes out the lot. She stares incredulously
                after him once he has gone. Now Beast Boy is hemmed in and gives a surprised little
                yelp; the enemies dog-pile on him, whereupon he turns into a bull and bucks them
                away. More close in, and he snorts in preparation to charge, but once again, the Boy
                Wonder leaps into the fray and puts them all down for the count.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to Raven in midair.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Azarath Metrion Zin--</sp>

            <sd>She has no chance to finish the spell; the overactive Titan is there in a flash to
                beat the stuffing out of the commandos menacing her. She just looks around, deadpan
                but slightly bewildered, and sees him leap across the warehouse to engage another
                group. Sight gag: the other Titans, as infants up against the wall, watch in sheer
                confusion while the shadows of the battle play back and forth across them. A piece
                of a head tumbles past, followed by a beaten attacker and Robin himself; zoom in on
                the four, who wince as the pounding gets louder.</sd>

            <sd>The sight gag ends, and Robin jumps onto the fallen robot whose head was partially
                smashed away. He starts bashing the remains of the metal skull with his staff; pan
                to the other Titans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh, Robin? I think you got him.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Yes, please.<sd>Cut to Robin; she continues
                    o.c.</sd>You may stop now.</sp>

            <sd>Only her hands on his bring the walloping to a close.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>We are victorious.</sp>

            <sd>He stands up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Slade's got his finger on the button, and we've got
                    nothing!<sd>He retracts his staff.</sd>Does that sound like a victory to
                you?</sp>

            <sd>He stalks away, leaving the others staring after him and trying to figure out what
                could have turned him into a one-man wrecking crew. Dissolve to outside the
                warehouse, just above the doors Cyborg blew out, and tilt down to him and Beast
                Boy.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Okay. We know the Chronoton Detonator was here. Now
                we just have to figure out where it went.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>No problem. We should split up and--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>walks into view</sd>--Waste hours searching only to come up empty-handed?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Well, when you say it like that--?</sp>

            <sd>Starfire lands by them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Raven is right. We must find some way to track
                the device.</sp>

            <sd>Robin approaches on the end of this line, then cocks an eyebrow quizzically at the
                sound of echoing footsteps. At a distance, a man is walking between two of the
                warehouses; a large shadow is cat on the wall behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Freeze!</sp>

            <sd>He is off like a shot; the spooked fellow races along the way, but a birdarang
                flashes into view and embeds itself in the concrete, bringing him up short. Robin
                follows it down, throws him against the wall, and holds up a small crest with
                Slade's S insignia on it, taken from one of the robots.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Tell me everything you know about this!</sp>

            <sd>The frightened chap can only stutter and mumble inarticulately.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Answer me! Now!</sp>

            <sd>He shoves the man to the wall, harder.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Man">Man</spkr>I've never seen it before! I don't know anything!
                Honest!</sp>

            <sd>As he says this, Raven's powers spread over Robin's torso. The
                Titan-turned-Dirty-Harry is then slung across to the wall of the opposite warehouse
                and pinned to it as she maintains her hold, the other three approach.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You said you could handle it.</sp>

            <sd>She releases him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>You promised.</sp>

            <sd>He slides down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>We're wasting time.</sp>

            <sd>He strides off.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>calling after him</sd>You know, just 'cause we're trying to catch Slade doesn't
                mean you have to act like him!</sp>

            <sd>Robin stops in his tracks, as we have already seen, being compared to this man hits
                him in all the wrong spots.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>whirling around</sd>Don't you ever compare me to him!<sd>He walks back.</sd>
                He's trying to destroy the city. I'm trying to save it!</sp>

            <sd>Pull back briefly to a long shot of the group, then cut to them again. The rest of
                the Titans are, to borrow a line from Dr. Seuss, puzzling until their puzzlers are
                sore. Suddenly, Starfire lets off a violent sneeze, accompanied by a starbolt that
                shoots from her nose. When the glare clears out, all four of the others are stunned
                and smoking from the blast. Her next three lines sound rather congested, as if
                spoken by someone with hay fever.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Gesundheit.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>flushed, sniffling</sd>Forgive me. I am allergic to metallic chromium. There
                must be a source near--</sp>

            <sd>She gets ready to sneeze again; everyone bails out, and the camera pulls back to a
                long shot of the waterfront as she lets it rip with another nasal starbolt. At the
                scene, the smoke clears to expose her, standing alone. Pull back as she sniffles,
                wipes her nose, and groans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Sorry.</sp>

            <sd>The other four return, Beast Boy from behind a trash can, Robin rappelling down from
                the warehouse roof, Raven passing through the wall. Cyborg is the only one to simply
                walk up; he looks down at his forearm.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Interesting.</sp>

            <sd>His perspective, looking at a graph readout on his panel. She wipes her nose
                again.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>sniffling and groaning a bit</sd>Not really. On my world, chromium allergies are
                quite common.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No. The key component of a Chronoton Detonator is a
                metallic chromium core, which means--</sp>

            <sd>He closes the panel; pull back to show Beast Boy next to him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>--Starfire can track it!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to her and zoom in slightly as she sniffles, then fade to black.</sd>

        <act n="2">
            <title>Act Two</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the inside wall of a sewer tunnel. The camera rotates to point down
                the way; from around a bend, Starfire unloads another high-powered sneeze. Cut to
                her, slogging through the water and wiping her nose with a groan.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>congested</sd>I believe it is this way.</sp>

            <sd>Pan to the others, who have thrown up their arms to protect themselves from the
                blast. After a moment, they move out with Robin bringing up the rear.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Look, guys, uh-- about earlier.</sp>

            <sd>They stop.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>It'll have to wait.</sp>

            <sd>She points ahead, pan in that direction to show a small speedboat in the tunnel,
                with the detonator, back in its original compact form--loaded in the back. A
                commando guarding the rig catches sight of the group.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy becomes a falcon as they charge. The robot moves to the instrument panel
                and hits the throttle, speeding off down the tunnel.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Quick! We can't let him get away!</sp>

            <sd>A section of the wall smashes out next to him, and a large stone hand reaches
                through and drags him away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Robin!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the other side of the hole, pointing in at the sewer. As the other four wade
                past, the sound of a fight is heard. They stop to watch; cut to their side. Robin is
                mixing it up with Cinderblock.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Get the detonator! Go!</sp>

            <sd>All but Starfire follow orders; cut to her, still watching.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Star! You heard the man!</sp>

            <sd>Reluctantly, she sets off after them. Robin leaps from one support column to another
                and stays just ahead of Cinderblock, who destroys each one with a single blow.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Only fair to warn you: you caught me on a bad
                day!</sp>

            <sd>The stone behemoth growls and charges. Robin moves in as well; cut to a close-up of
                each pair of pounding feet, then pull back as the Titan vaults high over Cinderblock
                and hurls a pair of bolas-weighted balls connected with a rope. These land on the
                head and tangle up around it, and Robin follows with a flying spin kick. Cut to the
                tunnel; the speedboat zooms ahead. Starfire, carrying Cyborg, flies after it, and
                Raven and Beast Boy are right behind her. The robot presses one of a row of buttons
                on the control panel.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Computer">Computer</spkr>Defense mode activated.</sp>

            <sd>These words appear on a small screen above the buttons. Now two lasers on the stern
                open up with a barrage of shots that forces everyone to swerve back and forth. The
                chase moves around a junction; Starfire keeps dodging the shots.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>breaks out his cannon</sd>I will not be having attitude from a boat!</sp>

            <sd>He keeps getting it, though, in the form of a new fusillade. Back to Robin and
                Cinderblock; the former lands in a crouch, then pushes off from the ground for a
                flying roundhouse kick that staggers the latter. Another kick, a crushing left hook,
                and Robin touches down in front of the dazed enemy and seizes him. Cinderblock is
                thrown down onto his back, and Robin climbs atop his chest.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Where is he?<sd>Close-up.</sd>Where's-- huh?</sp>

            <sd>His attention is drawn by a beeping from o.c. Cut to the source-a small tracking
                device in Cinderblock's open hand. Robin climbs down and picks up the item; cut to
                it. The screen shows a map of the area with two flashing dots. Zoom in, then cut to
                a close-up. One dot is an arrow, and the camera follows it to the other; Slade's
                mark. Extreme close-up of Robin's wide, wondering eyes, then of the flashing S, then
                of him. A cold smile spreads across his face-now he knows exactly where to find his
                archenemy.</sd>

            <sd>The sewer again. The Titans continue their pursuit of the speedboat. On the next
                line, pull back to show this as the view on one of the large monitors in Slade's
                lair; he is watching the chase from different angles.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Hurry, young Titans. Your time is running out.</sp>

            <sd>On a high catwalk behind him, a door is blown out but he does not even flinch. The
                smoke clears to show Robin's silhouette in the light from outside.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Actually...<sd>Close-up.</sd>...we just went into
                overtime.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Robin. Welcome. I've been expecting you for some
                    time.<sd>as Robin drops to the platform</sd>I was beginning to wonder if
                Cinderblock was too much of a challenge.</sp>

            <sd>He turns around and holds up the transmitter seen during his earlier message.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Looking for this?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to just behind and to one side; he holds the device at Robin's eye level and
                waves it around.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Well...<sd>Cut to a spotlighted patch of floor; he sets it
                    down.</sd>...here it is.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back to frame both, on opposite sides of the transmitter.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>If you want it, come and take it.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a slow pan across each determined face, first Robin's, then Slade's, then
                back to Robin. His teeth bared in a silent snarl, he charges straight at the camera
                and goes into a mighty somersaulting leap. As he sails closer, he pulls his right
                fist back and lets out one cry of pure rage. After the screen has filled with the
                white of his eye, snap to black.</sd>

        </act>
        <act n="3">
            <title>Act Three</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the wake of the speedboat. It pulls away from the camera and races
                down the sewer tunnel, unleashing a burst of laser shots at the other four Titans.
                Cyborg returns fire with his cannon, then is whisked off by Starfire; one shot from
                the boat sends Beast Boy tumbling for a moment. He rights himself and falls in
                behind Raven. Now that cannon is blazing steadily away, and it puts both of the
                speedboat's guns out of action in short order. The commando at the helm opens up the
                throttle and zooms ahead, but Starfire gradually pulls even to hold Cyborg over the
                deck.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Thanks for the lift!</sp>

            <sd>She lets go of him and backs off. As soon as his feet hit the deck, he is running
                toward the commando, who starts punching buttons furiously. The screen above them is
                now blank.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Computer">Computer</spkr>Auto pilot engaged.</sp>

            <sd>These words appear. Cyborg's hand clamps onto the robot's shoulder; it looks that
                way at he camera pans to the grinning Titan. Pull back; as the others fly after the
                watercraft, a punch lands and the driver is flung over the stern. On the deck, the
                wheel is turning itself under the control of the automatic pilot program; Cyborg
                seizes it and tries to steer manually, but only succeeds in tearing it out. Starfire
                lands on the deck as he stares popeyed at it. Now he hammers several buttons.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Computer">Computer</spkr>Invalid code.</sp>

            <sd>The display changes to show these two words. The speedboat begins to swerve back and
                forth, giving the two yelling Titans quite a ride.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>under Cyborg's yells</sd>How does one halt this vehicle?</sp>

            <sd>His idea: by seizing the computer panel and ripping it out entirely. The speedboat
                emerges into a large open chamber and comes to a stop. Starfire smiles placidly as
                Cyborg regards the ruined hardware, and Raven and Beast Boy land on the deck. The
                green falcon returns to human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Please tell me that's not how you're planning to stop
                the detonator.</sp>

            <sd>Surprised, he blushes a bit as a big drop of sweat rolls down his temple.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh...</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>You do know how to stop it, don't you?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>How hard could it be?</sp>

            <sd>He throws the panel overboard and crosses the deck to the detonator. Kneeling next
                it, he reaches toward the surface and is surprised when the housing telescopes
                upward as it did in Slade's message. He falls backward with a grunt; pan to frame
                the entire device, then cut to a close-up of its red lights and tilt down slowly to
                the central area. Cyborg looks as if he has just realized how far he is in over his
                head.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Ooh.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Whatever we're gonna do, we should do it before Slade
                decides to trigger this thing.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a set of overhead gears in Slade's lair and tilt down to the ground. The
                transmitter sits near the camera. Robin tumbles into view at a distance, gets
                himself upright, and runs toward it. A huge leap carries him closer, but Slade hits
                him broadside with a flying kick. The two land facing each other.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Come now, Robin. You'll have to do better than that.
                I haven't even broken a sweat.</sp>

            <sd>He rushes, leaps, and does a midair backflip leading into a roundhouse kick that
                sends Robin reeling. The melee moves across the floor, with each landing blows in
                turn, and Slade plants another steel boot across Robin's chest. Snarling in rage,
                the Titan gets his head clear, and the two spar again until Slade catches Robin's
                fist.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Good technique.</sp>

            <sd>He bends the arm sharply at the elbow; we hear bones grinding against each other as
                Robin yells in pain. The hold turns into a throw that sends the hero skidding across
                the floor to slam into a wall. As he gets woozily to his feet, seen from ground
                level, Slade's foot steps into view near the camera.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Good,<sd>Cut to him.</sd>but not perfect.</sp>

            <sd>His head clear again, another yell of pure fury in his throat, Robin charges across
                the floor. He launches himself into the air, but one of those steel-gloved fists
                whistles out and hits home in the breadbasket. Close-up of Robin's stunned
                countenance, then of Slade's quietly cruel one, then pull back to frame both. The
                young man hangs in the air for a moment, supported by the fist that has just stopped
                him cold, and then slowly collapses. Extreme close-up of Slade's eye; he chuckles to
                himself.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to a close-up of the detonator core. A small square panel is at the heart of it,
                held in place by a screw at each corner. These are pulled out via Raven's
                telekinesis, and Cyborg reaches into view to remove the panel; this is his
                perspective. Behind it is a rotating, glowing red sphere. The next three lines are
                spoken in whispers.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>The chromium core.<sd>Cut to him and the
                    others.</sd>Very unstable. No sudden moves.</sp>

            <sd>He holds up the panel; Beast Boy quickly turns into an octopus, takes it from him,
                and sets it aside gingerly. As Cyborg reaches toward the machinery, Starfire gets
                ready to sneeze, her allergy exacerbated by being this close to that much chromium,
                and throws everyone into a panic. Raven creates a shield around the Tamaranean's
                head to contain the force of the coming blast; it holds, but just barely, and her
                hair is blown wildly out of place. She sniffles after the shield is taken down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>congested</sd>Please continue.</sp>

            <sd>She shakes her hair back into place and grins widely with an embarrassed little
                giggle. Cut to Cyborg's perspective; he holds up his forearm, which now shows a
                panel with a circuit diagram of the device. Three lights come on underneath it. Back
                to the group; Beast Boy resumes human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Okay.<sd>extends an acetylene torch from his
                    forefinger</sd>Now all we have to do is decouple the--</sp>

            <sd>His perspective on the end of this; he uses the torch to sever one of the cables
                running to the core. It begins to beep and rotate very quickly. Back to the
                group.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Well, that doesn't sound good.</sp>

            <sd>A flash, and we are back in Slade's lair. Robin tumbles across the floor and stays
                down for a few seconds, pounding his fist against the tiles with a loud groan. Slade
                steps into view near him; tilt up from feet to head.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>I understand your frustration, Robin. You hate losing
                as much as I do.<sd>Long shot, panning slowly across the place.</sd>One of the many
                qualities we have in common.</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of Robin. Once again, his sorest spot has been poked too hard, and he comes
                up into an uppercut that lifts Slade clear off his feet. Two more punches send the
                armored criminal genius to the floor, but he lands in a crouch and runs off. Giving
                him no quarter, Robin lands a string of savage blows to drop him flat on his back.
                Close-up of the transmitter; the Boy Wonder steps into view nearby and picks it
                up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>It's over, Slade!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>On the contrary, Robin.</sp>

            <sd>The thing starts to spark.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>It breaks apart in his hand with a small crackle of electricity. He stares down in
                total confusion; cut to Slade, stepping out from a dark recess among the
                machinery.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>This is only the beginning.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Where's the real trigger?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Trigger? There is no trigger, because there is no
                detonator.</sp>

            <sd>Robin's eyes widen even more. Cut to the detonator core, still beeping and spinning
                like mad. Beast Boy's teeth are chattering a mile a minute as the two girls stare
                over Cyborg's shoulders.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>whispers</sd>Moment of truth, y'all.<sd>holds up his finger torch</sd> Everybody
                ready?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I can't watch!</sp>

            <sd>He covers his eyes, but parts his fingers to give one of them a clear field of
                vision. Cyborg rakes his flame across a couple of other cables to cut them, and the
                core stops its activity entirely. The red glow fades to leave the sphere looking
                like an ordinary metal ball. Beast Boy, Cyborg, and Raven sigh loudly and visibly
                with relief as Starfire smiles; the moment is short-lived, though, as a loud, urgent
                alarm goes off and elicits gasps and wide-eyed stares from all four. The core starts
                to spin and glow again, and red light spreads from it along the cables that have not
                been broken. Now the alarm slows down a bit as the red lights on the detonator's
                housing start to pulsate, and the topmost section retracts slightly. Beast Boy
                screams shrilly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>We blew it! We'll be frozen in time
                forever!</sp>

            <sd>The alarm gives way to a steady drone, and the whole device shorts out and crumbles
                into a pile of junk. Beast Boy is ready to have a fit, but stops when the rig falls
                silent.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Um...why are we not frozen in time
                forever?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Because this wasn't a Chronoton Detonator. It was a
                fake!</sp>

            <sd>Behind them, at the prow, a weapon pops out and sweeps back and forth, strafing all
                four Titans and knocking them overboard. One by one, their heads break the surface;
                no apparent damage from the assault. Beast Boy shakes off the water with a cry of
                revulsion.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>So aside from the nasty taste of sewer water
                in my mouth, I think I'm okay.</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg checks his forearm panel.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Diagnostic sensors say I'm just fine.</sp>

            <sd>He knocks water out of his ears.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Whatever that beam was supposed to do, it didn't do
                it.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Then...we are victorious?</sp>

            <sd>Her image starts to rotate, zooms in, and then goes into a series of dissolves.
                First, we see the tissues within her body, then a closer view of these, then
                individual blood cells moving in an artery. The next transition shows tiny metal
                spheres, marked with Slade's S, attaching themselves to these cells, deposited by
                the beam that hit the Titans. One final dissolve shows a row of four monitors, each
                marked with the name of one of these four Titans, showing a picture of the blood
                vessels and a readout of vital signs. Every cell is carrying a device along with it.
                Tilt down slightly as Slade steps into view; we are back in his lair, and these are
                his monitors.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Nanoscopic probes. The Chronoton Detonator was merely
                the bait for a much larger trap.</sp>

            <sd>As he continues, a small push-button device extends itself from the inside of his
                wrist and settles in his hand.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>You see, with the push of a button...</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of it, his thumb poised above, and pan slightly to show Robin glaring at
                it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>...my probes will destroy your friends from the inside out.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>You can't control them. No matter what you threaten,
                they'll never obey you.</sp>

            <sd>Back to Slade; he paces around Robin.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>This isn't about your friends, Robin. It's about you.
                It's always been about you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>What?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>Sending trouble your way. Leaving cryptic clues for
                you to unravel. I was testing you. For some time now, I have been searching for an
                apprentice. Someone to follow in my footsteps.<sd>leans into Robin's face</sd>And,
                Robin, I've chosen you. Congratulations.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>No way would I ever work for--</sp>

            <sd>Slade holds up the button, thumb just barely clearing it, and he falls silent.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>If you join me, if you swear to serve me,<sd>Close-up
                    of his face.</sd>if you never speak to your friends again,<sd>Extreme close-up
                    of his eye.</sd>I will allow them to live.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Robin, staring in mute fear, and zoom in slowly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>But...<sd>The monitors; he steps into view.</sd>...if you disobey
                even the smallest request, I will annihilate them, Robin. And I'll make you
                    watch.<sd>Cut to Robin; he continues o.c.</sd>So, do we have a deal?</sp>

            <sd>Long, tense silence from the Titan, after which the camera tilts up to the overhead
                gears and into the blackness past them. This resolves into a street in Jump City. It
                is now nighttime. The rest of the Titans are far down the block.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Robin?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to them. Cyborg helps Beast Boy up from a manhole; Starfire has her communicator
                out and is speaking into it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Robin? Robin, please respond!<sd>lowers it and
                    looks at the others</sd>Why does he not answer?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>His locator's been deactivated.<sd>Beast Boy
                    brushes himself off.</sd>We have no way to find him.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Not good.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>into the communicator</sd>Robin, please. You must answer. Robin!</sp>

            <sd>Fade to black.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>over comm</sd>Please respond!</sp>

            <sd>Fade in to a close-up of his outfit, draped over a pipe in Slade's lair, and pan to
                a pool of light cast from above. A tiny red dot glows through the utility belt, an
                incoming call signal from the communicator in its pouch. A hazy figure can be seen
                in the harsh glare.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>over comm</sd>Robin, where are you?</sp>

            <sd>Zoom in on the figure, then cut to close-ups of the following. A black glove being
                pulled on; a steel wrist guard being snapped into place; a belt being buckled under
                a chest that is yellow on the left side and black on the right; a neck piece
                fastened under Robin's chin. He takes his hands away after this last action to
                reveal a silver S emblazoned over his heart, and the camera tilts up to his sullen,
                defeated face. Pull back to frame all of him; if the abandoned clothing did not show
                his renunciation clearly enough, this shot gets the point across beyond all doubt.
                Robin wears steel reinforcements just like those of Slade, who steps into the light
                behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Slade">Slade</spkr>I know it seems bad now. But trust me,<sd>He moves
                    away; close-up.</sd>you'll learn to like it.</sp>

            <sd>Head-on view of the former leader of the Titans, standing motionless in the white
                light from overhead. His expression has not changed one bit, nor does it do so as
                Slade passes in front of him. Pull back across the space; the new boss passes into
                the darkness, leaving him alone, and the camera backs up slowly. The light is shut
                off to black out the screen.</sd>
