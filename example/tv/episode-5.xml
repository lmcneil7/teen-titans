            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>Feels the fresh air.</sd>Mmm-mmm. Would you
                look at that. A little sunshine, a little breeze. Only one thing could make this day

            <sd><directNote kind="pull">Pull back a bit as he bends down again.</directNote> The thing in front of him is a barbecue

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Four and a half pounds of baby back ribs.</sp>

            <sd>He lifts the rack away on a platter. <directNote kind="cut">Cut to a picnic table, where <char>Robin</char> is digging
                into a burger and <char>Starfire</char> is heartily sucking something down through a straw.</directNote>
                Positioned just over her right shoulder, <directNote>the camera does not allow us to see her
                drink on the table</directNote>. <char>Cyborg</char> sits down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Man, I love picnic food!</sp>

            <sd>He buries his face in the ribs, chomping huge mouthfuls of pork, and <char>Robin</char> matches

            <sd>She swigs some more of it. Back to the two boys, who stop scarfing down their food
                to stare in surprise.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh, <char>Starfire</char>?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>That’s mustard.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Is there more?</sp>

            <sd>The sight gag ends; <char>Robin</char> and <char>Cyborg</char> cannot tear their eyes away from the scene and
                their food sits forgotten in their hands. A shred of meat is clearly heard falling
                from <char>Cyborg</char>’s face in the stillness. <directNote kind="pull">Pull back from the table</directNote> and <directNote kind="pan">pan to the tree
                where the grill is set up</directNote>. <char>Beast Boy</char>, as <transform class="mammal">a lemur</transform>, climbs around in the branches and
                hangs down from the lowest one by his tail; by the time he gets within reach of the
                grill, he is back in <transform class="human">human form</transform>. He picks up two hot dogs.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Sweet! My tofu dogs are cooked to perfection.

            <sd><charDesc ref="Beast Boy">The vegetarian Titan</charDesc> proceeds to wolf down both dogs at once. <char>Cyborg</char> runs past; <directNote kind="cut">cut

            <sd><char>Robin</char>, <char>Beast Boy</char>, and <char>Starfire</char> run over, clamoring to get into the game. They cut
                off abruptly and look in <char>Raven</char>’s direction; <directNote kind="cut">cut to her</directNote>. She has not moved an

            <sd><stageDesc category="close-up">Close-up of <char>Robin</char>, backing up to throw a pass.</stageDesc> He yells in sudden fear as the ground

                skids backward, then jumps onto <charDesc ref="Beast Bot">the green behemoth</charDesc>’s snout and runs straight down
                his back. Jumping clear of the tail, <char>Robin</char> fires a pass downfield. <directNote kind="cut">Cut to <char>Cyborg</char>,

            <sd>His face suddenly freezes, as does he, but <directNote kind="pan">the camera keeps panning ahead</directNote>. It
                finally stops and backs up quickly; <char>Cyborg</char> might as well be a statue for his total

            <sd>Something starts beeping; an alarm from his systems, and he looks at his forearm.

                    it.</sd>Mumbo Jumbo!</sp>

            <sd>Pointing the wand at the ground, he conjures up a burst of light and smoke that
                fills the screen; when it clears, he is gone. <directNote kind="cut">Cut to the entrance to Tito's
                Junkyard, where he races into view.</directNote> His legs are pistoning so fast that they look
                something like those of the Road Runner in top gear. <char>Mumbo</char> races through the piles
                of discarded items, then skids to a stop and snaps his fingers. A large diamond,
                part of his haul from the robbery, appears between them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>inspecting it with a loupe</sd>Not bad for a

            <sd>The villainous legerdemain artist gasps and looks back over his shoulder; pan
                quickly to a ledge overlooking the junkyard. All the Titans save Cyborg are
                there.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Now hand over the jewels before the critics decide to

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Now, Robin, I'm sure there's a peaceful solution
                    here...<sd>He produces a lit bomb in each hand.</sd>...but this isn't it!</sp>

            <sd>He flings them at the four, who dive for cover to avoid the explosions. Laughing,
                Mumbo plucks a flower from his lapel and tosses it at Robin; it goes off at his feet
                and just misses him. The Boy Wonder lands at the edge of a trash pit, ready to go
                again, but Cyborg's hand reaches up and pulls him in before he can do anything. The
                black mask hangs briefly in the air before falling after him. Cut to inside; the big
                fellow has something strapped to his back.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Who said you could start the party without me?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Cyborg?! What about your power cell?</sp>

            <sd>Something explodes very close to them; cut to the cackling Mumbo, who now has a
                handful of cherry bombs and is letting them fly in all directions. Starfire and
                Raven have taken cover behind neighboring junk piles, and they return fire;
                starbolts from the former, a few strategically levitated and aimed pieces of waste
                from the latter. Mumbo dodges both girls' counterattacks and then jumps very high to
                avoid Beast Boy's charge as a velociraptor.</sd>

            <sd>Back to Robin and Cyborg in the pit.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Go home. Get fixed. We can handle this without

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I got it covered.</sp>

            <sd>He turns around, showing the thing on his back to be four car batteries wired
                together.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>External battery pack.<sd>He brings out his sonic
                    cannon.</sd>Teen Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>One giant leap carries him out of the pit. Close-up of Mumbo, with his hat off.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>Pull back; he has the hat in hand and is about to pull something out of it. A blast
                from the cannon hurls him to the other end of the junkyard; he groans as a tin can
                bounces off his head and the hat rolls to a stop nearby. Putting it on and standing
                up, he tugs at his shirt sleeve and starts to pull a long rope of knotted-together
                handkerchiefs from it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Nothing up my sleeve...<sd>getting to the end, he
                    whips the rope forth</sd>...and, presto!</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg is dashing in, but the silks wrap themselves tightly around his body to
                immobilize him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No!</sp>

            <sd>He is spilled to the ground in an instant. A sound from o.c. draws Mumbo's attention
                elsewhere; cut to the source, Robin, angling himself for a flying kick. Mumbo stands
                near one end of a pipe that juts from the trash piles.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Need a hand?</sp>

            <sd>He reaches into the pipe, and his hand comes out the other end; an impossibly long
                reach for any mere mortal-and grabs Robin's cape. The young man flails his arms and
                legs, trying hopelessly to escape. Mumbo's other hand shoots out from several other
                pipes and gives him a high-speed beating.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</sp>

            <sd>She heaves a few large appliances at the prestidigitator, who has stopped thrashing
                Robin. He just stands there and dispels her magic with a gesture; the junk remains
                suspended in midair for a moment and becomes a shower of rose petals at another wave
                of the hand.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>You think that's good? Watch me pull a rabbit out of
                my hat!<sd>sweeps it off</sd>Hocus-pocus!</sp>

            <sd>Out comes a wave of stuffed rabbits that covers Raven from head to toe. Mumbo puts
                the hat back on and adjusts his gloves; now Beast Boy, as a bighorn sheep, thunders
                straight at him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>producing and spreading a deck of cards</sd>Pick
                a card, every card!</sp>

            <sd>Half the deck is now in each hand, and he throws the pasteboards straight ahead at
                the superhero. When they reach him, they have grown to many times normal size, large
                enough to sweep him off his feet.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>For my next trick, I'll require a lovely
                assistant.</sp>

            <sd>He whips a cane out of his cape on the end of this line and promptly reaches into
                the air with its hooked end. Cut to Starfire in flight; she is caught around the
                waist and yanked down with a cry of surprise. A few wooden slats assemble themselves
                into a floating box that encloses her entire body except for head and feet, which
                protrude from the ends. The next thing to be brought out of the mad magician's cape
                is a long handsaw, which he brandishes over her. Obviously, he is about to attempt
                the old sawing-a-woman-in-half trick.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>as a big sweat drop slides down behind Starfire's
                    head</sd>It's only fair to warn you...<sd>Cut to her; he continues o.c.</sd>
                ...I have no idea what I'm doing.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back. Cyborg shoots across the screen and nails him with a huge flying tackle,
                and the two slide among the trash heaps, throwing up thick clouds of dust. They
                clear to leave the four-hundred-pound Titan pinning the villain to the ground.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>I hate fighting dirty. Shall we clean you up?</sp>

            <sd>A jet of water squirts from the flower in his lapel, hitting Cyborg with the force
                of a fire hose and throwing him over the garbage mountains. He lands in a nearby
                dump truck; cut to inside. The water has shorted out his jury-rigged power supply
                and knocked it off his back. A red light starts to flash on his forearm; close-up of
                the display panel, counting down from five seconds. Pull back as he tries to climb
                out, then cut to the panel again. The timer reaches zero, and his systems shut down
                as they did in the prologue. Frozen in place, he offers no resistance as the dump
                truck's hydraulics kick into gear. The load of garbage is dumped out the back,
                taking Cyborg and the car batteries with it, and falls into a Dumpster whose floor
                has rusted away. Beneath it is the entrance to an underground cavern; the refuse
                tumbles away in the blackness.</sd>

            <sd>Robin runs to the truck.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Cyborg? Cyborg!</sp>

            <sd>It kicks into gear; Mumbo is at the wheel.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Exit stage left.</sp>

            <sd>He floors the accelerator and peels out. The other three Titans gather behind Robin;
                Beast Boy is back in human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Titans! He's got Cyborg!</sp>

            <sd>They spread out to start a search. Dissolve to an overhead view of the Dumpster and
                zoom in slowly, then dissolve to just inside the cavern and tilt down from the
                entrance. The missing Titan lies immobile among the rest of the trash; around him in
                the gloom, several round red eyes light up. He is dragged slowly toward them, after
                which they wink out. Fade to black.</sd>

        <act n="2">

            <sd>A horizontal band of white light crosses the middle of the screen and widens to fill
                the entire view. The brightness yields to a shot of a large circular chamber with
                strong overhead lights; the camera is pointing up at the ceiling. Cyborg's hand
                reaches into view in time with his weary groans; this is his perspective. His
                systems are working again. A male voice begins to speak; very level, measured,
                almost monotonic.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Voice">Voice</spkr>You are operational.</sp>

            <sd>The speaker moves into view and looks down at Cyborg. It is a tall android figure
                swathed in a long robe; all we can see for the moment is the head, which sports a
                flat, angular face marked by two glowing blue slits for eyes. Instead of hair,
                circuit pathways cover the scalp. This is Fixit.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>That is good.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back. Lying on a large table, Cyborg has several wires plugged into his chest.
                He groans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>What's going--?</sp>

            <sd>The Titan reaches overhead and pulls down one of the lights to aim it across the
                chamber. Cut to a motley group of robots in another area; their eyes glow red,
                marking them as the ones that towed him in here.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Who are you?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>You were broken. I have brought you
                here to be repaired.</sp>

            <sd>On the end of this, the light reaches the ceiling and tilts down to illuminate him.
                He crosses the chamber.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Where's "here"?</sp>

            <sd>Fixit moves into view near the camera; his robe blacks out the screen. From here,
                dissolve to a group of buildings in Jump City, seem from ground level. A plume of
                smoke wafts into view, and the camera pans/tilts down to the source; it is the dump
                truck Cyborg landed in, which has crashed into a building. The other four Titans
                have caught up to it. Mumbo is nowhere in sight.</sd>

            <sd>Snap to black, then fade in to a close-up of Cyborg's forearm. He opens the display
                panel and finds the power bar completely lit and the message "Full Power 100%."</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Charging is complete. The new power

            <sd>Pull back; Cyborg is unplugged and sitting up. A couple of hovering robots complete
                a repair scan and float away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Yeah.<sd>stretches</sd>I'm feeling better. Lots

                Fixit.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to ceiling level; mechanical junk of all types tumbles into the chamber from an
                overhead chute. Tilt down to ground level as Fixit goes over to the pile.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Things come to me broken. I make repairs.<sd>He picks
                    up two small parts.</sd>Let me see.<sd>They float out of his hands; he studies
                    them.</sd>Yes...yes...hmm...pity.<sd>He picks up another one.</sd> Interesting.
                The damage is too extensive.<sd>It floats; he takes up a fourth.</sd> Perhaps if we
                can find another processor.</sp>

            <sd>During the previous line, Cyborg gets off the table and watches Fixit for some
                seconds. Finally, he waves and starts to leave.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Well, thanks...for everything.</sp>

            <sd>Several of the red-eyed robots turn suddenly in his direction. The components Fixit
                had suspended in midair hit the ground, and he advances across the chamber with a
                new note of urgency in his voice.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>You cannot leave.</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg, at the exit, stops and turns back.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Quite. Will you remain? It is for the best.</sp>

                    controls</sd>Let me just tell my friends where I am.</sp>

            <sd>His back turned to Fixit, he does not notice that the android's eyes have gone red.
                What he does notice is that when the display panel for his built-in communicator
                opens, it shows a badly garbled signal; jammed by the proprietor of the place.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Whoa!<sd>Fixit's eyes go blue again.</sd> Something
                really is wrong with me.</sp>

            <sd>He shuts it off.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>gestures to the table</sd>Rest now. You may
                contact your friends later.<sd>Cyborg climbs up.</sd>I am sure they are not too
                concerned.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>lying down</sd>Maybe they should be.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the other four Titans racing through the streets, then to a building front
                that has been garishly decorated with rainbow-colored clouds and stars. No points
                for guessing who did this bit of graffiti. Pan to a parked bus, which disappears in
                a puff of smoke, then to the location where it materializes; a block or so down the
                road. The camera moves on to another corner, where a mailbox jumps into view under
                its own power, spits out a live rabbit, and bounces away a bit before doing this
                again. Pan to follow a young woman as she floats out from around this corner; ten
                feet or so off the ground, horizontal, headfirst, with three large hoops encircling
                her body. The old "levitating woman" trick has received a new twist thanks to
                Mumbo.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I'll say this much for Mumbo; he's an easy act
                to follow.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Oh, I would commit myself to a life of
                muck-shoveling in the filth mines of Cornex if Cyborg could only be returned
                safely.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>He was malfunctioning. He shouldn't have been

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>from o.c., distant</sd>Mumbo-jumbo!</sp>

            <sd>The sound of a spell being cast is heard, and all four Titans run toward it. Cut to
                an ATM at a street corner; it is spewing a mountain of cash onto the sidewalk. As
                the heroes run up, the camera pans away from them a bit to show two other machines
                exhibiting the same green diarrhea. Mumbo is at the last one, hammering away at its
                keypad. He laughs, then cocks an eyebrow at the new arrival and sweeps his hat off;
                a replacement for the one he lost.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Sorry, folks.</sp>

            <sd>He holds the hat upright, open end down; all the money is promptly sucked up into it
                as if it were a vacuum cleaner, after which he puts it back on.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>No time for autographs.</sp>

            <sd>He runs o.c.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Titans! Get him!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to inside an alley. The magician runs along its course as Raven flies after
                him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Open, says me!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the wall at the alley's dead end. Responding to his command, the bricks
                disappear, several at a time, to make an opening big enough for him to pass through.
                They pop back into place just in time to stop Raven from following. Cut to Mumbo,
                still running along. A loud lowing causes him to hit the brakes and yell in fear;
                pull back as the source steps into view, Beast Boy as a large bull. He snorts
                angrily and charges, and the camera cuts to his perspective as Mumbo pulls his cape
                off and holds it in front of him. The garment is jerked away to reveal that a brick
                wall has suddenly appeared behind it. Beast Boy rams this head on, and the camera
                pulls back from the impact to show him lying dazed next to its remains. Mumbo steps
                out from behind the masonry, his cape back on, and turns his hat into a sombrero
                with a flick of the wrist.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Olé!</sp>

            <sd>He turns the headgear back to normal and runs off down the alley. However, he is not
                alone for long; Starfire flies over the roof of an adjacent building and throws a
                starbolt at him as she takes over the pursuit. Overhead view of him, with her shots
                peppering the ground on either side. She pulls into view, and the camera cuts to
                him; he conjures a bouquet in one hand.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Flowers for the lady.</sp>

            <sd>He tosses the bunch up over his shoulder and they explode in her face. A few more
                steps bring him to another dead end, where Robin drops into view to square off. His
                handy-dandy fighting staff is out and fully extended for a twirl in no time
                flat.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Abracadabra!</sp>

            <sd>A flash of light, and the metal shaft has turned into a cobra. Robin yells in
                surprise and drops the venomous creature. Close-up of it on the ground as Mumbo's
                shadow passes by and his laughter is heard, then cut to him running up a flight of
                stairs to make his escape. All four Titans charge after him, Beast Boy back in human
                form.</sd>

            <sd>Close-up of Cyborg's full power gauge; pull back slightly. This is his
                perspective.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I don't get it. All my sensors say I'm fine.</sp>

            <sd>He lowers his arm; Fixit approaches.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Your sensors are incomplete. Mine are more
                precise.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Guess I'm just...<sd>Pull back; he lies on the
                    table; fully wired up.</sd>...getting kinda nervous. How long am I gonna be down
                here, anyway?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a gathering of robots on the chamber floor. A small droid floats past
                them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Repairs could take some time.
                    <sd>Cut to him.</sd>Besides, why would you want to leave?<sd>The droid reaches
                    him; he grasps it.</sd>Look around you.</sp>

            <sd>A cable extends itself down from the ceiling, plugs into a port on Fixit's forehead,
                and begins to glow red.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Look at yourself.<sd>Another droid floats over.</sd>
                You belong with us.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No, I don't. I mean, you've got a nice place here
                and you've been really cool to me, but...<sd>Back to Fixit; he continues o.c.</sd>
                ...I couldn't live down here. I don't know how you can.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>What do you mean? The power supply is adequate.
                Replacement parts are easy to find.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I need more than that! What about sunlight? What
                about fresh air? What about food?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>I do not require these things.<sd>The cable
                    disconnects.</sd>And when repairs are complete...<sd>walking o.c.</sd>
                ...neither will you.</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg gets himself vertical and unplugs the lines hooked into his body.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You know what? I'm feeling all right now. So thanks
                anyway, but I'm just gonna go.</sp>

            <sd>He walks away. Fixit turns from his work and puts even more urgency and command into
                his voice than when the patient first tried to clear out.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Stay.</sp>

            <sd>His eyes go red. Cyborg suddenly finds a number of spectator robots blocking his
                path. He takes a step back and is surprised by a few small ones that jump onto his
                shoulders and chest and grip firmly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Yo, what are you--?<sd>A flexible arm reaches into
                    view and grabs his wrist.</sd>Hey!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the source, another robot. It reaches out with its other arm.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Let me go!</sp>

            <sd>Back to him; the second arm clamps onto his other wrist. He struggles against the
                contraptions' hold on him, but cannot break free. Pull back a distance; several
                other members of Fixit's legions extend cattle prods from their upper surfaces and
                electrify them. The current races along the two extended arms toward the captive,
                and as he starts to scream, the camera cuts to Fixit's emotionless countenance and
                pans to follow his gaze back to the table. It tilts until it is nearly vertical, and
                Cyborg is carried into view and placed on it. He has been securely bound.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Repairs are not yet complete.</sp>

            <sd>The table swivels a bit to give the Titan a direct view of a large closed door. Zoom
                in slowly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Your biological components are
                imperfect and must be replaced.</sp>

            <sd>The door hisses open, releasing a cloud of vapor. Behind it is only blackness, but
                after a second or two this yields to show, hanging on a support framework, an array
                of secondhand robotic parts; enough to replace every remaining natural portion of
                Cyborg's body. The face is missing its left eye, since he already has an implant on
                that side. A small gasp is heard from the o.c intended recipient of this overhaul.
                Cut to an extreme close-up of him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>horrified</sd>No.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to a close-up of the robotic face. Everything except the glowing red right
                eye fades to black; it does the same a moment later.</sd>

        </act>
        <act n="3">
            <title>Act Three</title>
            <sd>The screen remains black as the following line is spoken and the words are typed
                up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Computer2">Computer 2</spkr>Biological components removed. Repairs

                your new face.</sp>

            <sd>The view flickers and gives way to a shot of Cyborg, seen from behind and looking in
                a mirror. Every last scrap of organic tissue has been switched out for the
                artificial parts that had hung on the rack. He rubs a hand down the side of his
                face, then raises it in a fist with a growl of rage. Close-up of the reflection; the
                fist comes down and shatters the glass. Behind it is blackness, with a point of
                light shining in the distance and shooting rays toward the camera. Cyborg is sucked
                into view toward this; it starts to grow, filling the screen.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>NOOOOOOOOO!!</sp>

            <sd>A flash of white, and we see him on Fixit's examining table; back to normal, wired
                up, and now held to the table with thick steel bands. He yells in pure fear as his
                eyes snap open; the previous scene was a nightmare.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Do not be afraid.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to him by the table. His eyes have assumed their normal blue color.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>You were dreaming.<sd>walking o.c.</sd>Sleep will not

                repaired? What if I like me this way?</sp>

            <sd>Fixit goes to the rack of parts.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Such thoughts come from your imperfect biological
                components.</sp>

            <sd>He raises a hand; a tool floats into it, and he does a bit of welding on he
                face.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>They will be replaced momentarily.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Not if I can help it.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a rooftop. Mumbo leaps into view and bounds from building to building.
                Starfire flies after him, then Raven, and Beast Boy brings up the rear as a
                kangaroo. The crazed magician makes one impossible jump after another as the three
                Titans struggle to keep up. Pull back to an overhead view; Robin gets into the
                action, hoofing it along the rooftops of higher buildings. After a few more blocks,
                Mumbo stops dead and whirls to face them, bringing his wand to the ready.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Abracadabra!</sp>

            <sd>He waves the wand; cut to the two flyers and the hopper as they scatter to avoid the
                hexes.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Alakazam! Hocus-pocus!</sp>

            <sd>Back to him. He laughs madly, the top of his head flapping clear of his neck after
                the style of the Canadian characters on South Park.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>You'll never stop the Amazing Mumbo! Never! Ne--</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of his wand hand on the end of this line. Something black and green whips
                past and carries the prop with it. Pull back; Mumbo is caught completely off
                guard.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Robin, holding aloft the wand he swiped; he breaks it in half. Mumbo screams
                as bags of money, all the loot from his crime spree, go flying out of his pockets.
                He then cries a waterfall while his top hat shrinks and disappears; finally, he
                collapses o.c. Pull back to reveal that he is now an ordinary-looking old fellow, on
                his knees among the vast amounts of cash. Starfire, Raven, and Beast Boy touch down
                behind him, and Robin's shadow falls across him from the front. He is dragged up by
                his shirt front for a little face-to-face talk.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>No more tricks! Where, is, Cyborg?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>How should I know?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Where is he?!?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You took him from the junkyard!</sp>

            <sd>Pull back to frame everyone; Beast Boy is in human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>What have you done with him?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>Nothing! Honest! When you broke the wand, you broke
                all my spells. Even if I had done something, it'd be over now. Poof! He'd be
                standing right here.</sp>

            <sd>Robin drops him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>If Cy's not with him, then he's still back

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr><sd>smiling nervously</sd>So, do I still have to go
                to jail?</sp>

            <sd>He gets a very nasty look from the four Titans and his face falls. A big drop of
                sweat slides down his temple.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Mumbo">Mumbo</spkr>I thought so.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Cyborg, now straining mightily against the steel bands that hold him to the
                table. Zoom in past him to Fixit, who continues his spot repairs on the new parts.
                He stops after a moment.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>I am ready. We will begin now.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Perfect timing.</sp>

            <sd>A mighty surge of muscle power breaks him loose. Unplugging himself, he slides off
                the table and makes a run for it. Fixit's eyes go red as he beams a command; cut to
                just outside the exit door, which closes in response. Cyborg gasps an instant before
                it seals itself, blacking out the screen; snap to him inside.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I didn't want to have to do this, but...</sp>

            <sd>He reconfigures his arm into cannon mode and prepares to fire, but the weapon merely
                fizzles out with a wisp of smoke.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>Fixit's eyes are blue again.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>advances toward the camera</sd>Your defensive
                systems have been disabled for the procedure. They will be reactivated when repairs
                are complete.</sp>

            <sd>Snarling, Cyborg runs at him, but a red-eye flash sends several metal tentacles
                snaking down from the ceiling. They ensnare him just before he can tackle Fixit; he
                hauls fiercely at them and is able to reach one hand forward. Close-up of it, within
                inches of the hermit's robe. The fingers close on the fabric and pull it away, and
                the camera backs up to ground level and tilts up to give a good view of what is
                within. There is a jumble of internal organs heavily interwoven with cables and
                switches, even a small, fully jointed robotic arm. Fixit, then, is not a true
                android, but rather a mix of mechanical and organic parts just like the Titan he is
                trying to "repair."</sd>

            <sd>Cyborg sucks in a long, shocked gasp, but Fixit shows no trace of anger at having
                had his innards exposed to full view.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>The biological malfunctions are growing worse.
                    <sd>closes his robe</sd>We must begin at once.</sp>

            <sd>He moves o.c. Cut to the floor of the underground cavern; a circle of it is
                illuminated by the sunlight spilling in from above. The car batteries Cyborg had
                wired up to power himself lie in a jumble here. Robin drops into view and looks them
                over carefully; the other three Titans are gathered at the edge of the hole that
                leads in.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>His battery pack. He must have fallen down here.
                    <sd>Beast Boy jumps down as well.</sd>Star! Can you give us some light?</sp>

            <sd>Pull back; now all four Titans are underground. One of Starfire's hands begins to
                glow, and she holds it up to substitute for a torch. They advance into the
                gloom.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Cyborg!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Cy!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Cyborg!</sp>

            <sd>After they have passed o.c., leaving the screen blacked out, snap to a long shot of
                the chamber. Cyborg has again been secured to the table, and Fixit has bent to his
                work. Sparks fly from the welding in progress, to the sound of weak moaning.
                Close-up of one hand, which twitches convulsively, then of Fixit's expressionless
                face. The sparks' glare plays over his flat features.</sd>

            <sd>Snap to black, the lightless exterior part of the cavern. The other four teammates
                advance into view, but stop at the sound of machinery moving o.c. Robin gasps in
                surprise; pull back to frame the source, one after another of Fixit's robots,
                blocking the forward path and cutting off retreat. Beast Boy cranes his neck for a
                look at the biggest of the lot.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Wow...<sd>He chuckles nervously.</sd>Uh, any
                of you guys seen a dude about this tall with one red eye and titanium body
                armor?</sp>

            <sd>He reaches up to indicate the height on "this tall," then turns his left eye red and
                adopts an approximate likeness of Cyborg in time with the other two features he
                names. The robots' only response is to step forward in readiness for battle. Robin
                backs up a step of his own; Beast Boy has assumed his normal appearance.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Teen Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>Starfire stays put while the other three spread out. She throws a string of
                starbolts at the robot advancing toward her and blows it apart with the last one.
                Robin punches another to send sparks flying, then smashes it to junk with a high
                kick. A third is forcing Beast Boy back into the inky shadows, so that his eyes are
                all that can be seen of him. We hear a low growl from that corner, and the lights
                come up to show that he has transformed into a huge gorilla and caught the
                mechanical aggressor in a crushing grip. He tears it apart and sets out to find
                others.</sd>

            <sd>Raven raises her arm to cast a spell as the lights go out entirely on her. Two black
                slashes of energy cross the screen; fade in to show the biggest robot of the lot,
                with two glowing incisions crossing its upper body. The thing shorts out, slides
                apart along the fault lines Raven has opened, and explodes.</sd>

            <sd>Close-up of Fixit's tray of tools. One floats up, then another; pull back to frame
                him, still hard at work. The two devices hover nearby within easy reach, and he
                takes one of them in hand after a moment. A piece of Cyborg's armor plating clatters
                to the floor. Now Fixit takes the robotic face off the rack; cut to a close-up of
                the madly struggling Titan as the shadow of his single-minded repairman falls over
                him, then to his perspective.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Do not resist. It is for the best.</sp>

            <sd>He lowers the face toward the camera. Cut to Cyborg.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No, it isn't! If you take out my biological
                components...</sp>

            <sd>The face is set in place; his next three lines sound as if they are coming through a
                speaker set in it. Extreme close-up of the right eye behind the red glass.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>...you take out the best part of me! The part that
                makes me who I am!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>Your memories, your "self", will be preserved.
                    <sd>His eyes go red; close-up of them.</sd>I will download them into your new
                brain.</sp>

            <sd>The port on his forehead opens to allow a cable to extend outward. It plugs itself
                into Cyborg's new face, right between the eyes.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>No...you can't do this, please! You don't
                understand!</sp>

            <sd>Extreme close-up of the right eye, squeezed tightly shut. It opens as the camera
                zooms in through the pupil.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>NOOOOOOOOO!!</sp>

            <sd>The screen flickers briefly and begins to show scenes from the prologue and Act One,
                dissolving from one to the next; Fixit is copying memories to his own system. Pan
                across the park...Cyborg, Robin, Starfire at the picnic table...Starfire hugging the
                mustard jar...Cyborg and Robin staring at her in disbelief...gathering for the
                football game...Raven asking what happened to him when he conked out (mirror image
                from original scene)...the start of the game's first play...Robin backing up for a
                pass...Beast Boy counting down to tackle...the ball sailing through the air...Cyborg
                going long for the catch...the other four Titans, waiting to see if he will come
                around from the shutdown...Starfire and Robin helping him up...the boy with the
                artificial hand running up to say hello...the catcher's mitt being removed to expose
                the prosthesis...then a flash of white, and we are back in the chamber. Fixit cries
                out and stumbles away from Cyborg, the connecting cable retreating into his
                forehead. He crashes to the ground.</sd>

            <sd>In the outer portion of the cavern, the shots Starfire is holding in check light up
                the area again. She, Raven, and Beast Boy, the last back in human form, have found
                themselves staring at a great many robots who have been knocked out by their
                combined efforts. Pan to Robin, who is trying to catch his breath; he starts in
                surprise at the sound of o.c. machinery. Cut to the source, another squadron
                struggling to move forward, then to him as he backs up into the other three. The
                units totter toward them and then go dead-incapacitated by the shock to Fixit's
                system.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>The floor of the chamber. The face that was to have replaced Cyborg's drops next to
                the table, whose steel restraints have all been broken, and the real McCoy climbs
                off and kneels groaning next to it. Robin reaches into view and puts a hand on his
                shoulder.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Cyborg!<sd>Pull back to frame
                    both.</sd>Are you okay?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Yeah.</sp>

            <sd>They straighten up. Pull back; the other three Titans are in the chamber as
                well.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>from o.c., wistfully</sd>So...beautiful.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to just behind Cyborg and zoom in slowly over his shoulder. Fixit is kneeling by
                the rack of parts.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr>I had forgotten how beautiful. The world...
                    <sd>Cyborg walks up.</sd>...through your eyes.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Through human eyes. The same kind you have.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Fixit">Fixit</spkr><sd>looks at his hands</sd>Perhaps I am the one in
                need of repairs.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>And maybe I'm the guy who can help repair you.</sp>

            <sd>He holds out a hand, and the fellow mechanical half-breed smiles and takes hold,
                allowing himself to be helped to his feet.</sd>

            <sd>Dissolve to a patch of clear sky and tilt down to the park. Once again, people are
                enjoying the fine weather in their own way. Cut to a long shot of the Titans, save
                Cyborg, gathered around a picnic basket set out on a blanket. The fifth member of
                the team walks into view, carrying the football, but is stopped by a familiar
                voice.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Boy1">Boy 1</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd>Cyborg! Hey, Cyborg!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to him; he runs up, with his mitten gone and prosthesis fully exposed, and he
                has a friend with him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Boy1">Boy 1</spkr><sd>to his friend</sd>See? It's Cyborg. He's just like
                me!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Boy2">Boy 2</spkr>Whoa, cool!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I am just like you. But it's not your arm that
                makes us the same.<sd>Cut to the two; he points at the first boy's heart and
                    continues o.c.</sd>It's the stuff connected to it.</sp>

            <sd>Both beam at this; pull back to frame him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Now, go deep!</sp>

            <sd>They do so, laughing, and he lets the pigskin fly. Tilt up and pan to follow its
                spiraling flight across the park, then fade to black.</sd>
