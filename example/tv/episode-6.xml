            <title>Prologue</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the night sky above the buildings of Jump City. Tilt down to point
                along a street, where a vehicle can be seen turned on its side in the distance. A
                figure stands atop it, and a couple of Titans are facing off with him. In close-up,
                they are seen as Cyborg, Starfire, and Robin, and the vehicle is an armored car
                whose back doors have been broken open. Gold bullion spills out to the pavement. The
                bearded, helmeted male figure perched on it is clad in a skintight black outfit with
                a light bulb on the chest, and both hands glow very brightly. This is Doctor Light,
                not to be confused with the character of the same name from the Mega Man game
                series.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>Your pathetic skills can't outshine the
                brilliance of Doctor Light!</sp>

            <sd>He brings his hands together; the Titans scatter as a broad beam shoots toward them.
                Robin leaps high and flings a birdarang at the supervillain, who jumps down to avoid
                both it and the thrower's lunge.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>You're fast, but I doubt you'll enjoy
                moving at the speed of light!</sp>

            <sd>He touches the bulb on his chest, causing it to glow and emit a wide-angle blast
                that propels Robin over the roof of a nearby building. Beast Boy comes around a
                corner and charges, turning into a wolf as he runs. The robber easily ducks this
                rush.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>A wolf is no threat when it's blind as a
                bat!</sp>

            <sd>He throws several glowing globes at the green lupine hero. They explode in a series
                of brilliant flashes and leave him so dazzled that he reverts to human form and
                claps both hands to his head woozily. The next one in is Starfire, who flies
                overhead and throws a barrage of starbolts; Doctor Light creates a radiant shield
                around himself to block them. He drops it after she stops firing, then throws a
                landmine-like device into the street. Its top opens to emit a wall of radiation that
                envelops Starfire and blocks her in.</sd>

            <sd>Back to Doctor Light.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Watch yourself, lightweight.</sp>

            <sd>Pan to him by the armored car. He has half of one axle in hand, tire and all, and he
                moves in for a swing.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Things are about to get heavy!</sp>

            <sd>He swings the axle down over his head, missing the enemy, but creating enough of a
                tremor upon impact to throw him back a few feet. Doctor Light concentrates his
                energy in one hand and projects an intense beam that breaks the makeshift club in
                half. Laughing, he creates a red projectile and directs it at Cyborg; it explodes in
                a terrific flash and storm of dust. The view clears to show that the Titan is now
                embedded in stone, with only his head and hands free.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh! Hey! Let me..</sp>

            <sd>Doctor Light approaches.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>Now if nobody minds, I'll be taking the
                gold.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> I mind <sd>Cut to her in
                    midair.</sd> Azarath Metrion Zin--</sp>

            <sd>Before she can finish the incantation, a beam connects squarely with her and sends
                her to the street. He walks up behind her as she starts to get up. The brooch on her
                cloak now shows a raven's head in its gold frame, and it will continue do so
                throughout this episode.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>Bit of advice <sd>warms up</sd> Find
                shorter magic words.</sp>

            <sd>She gets herself ready again; pan to a motorcycle at the curb. It is levitated and
                slung at the light-wielding enemy, who easily blows it apart. He nails her with
                another blast and drives her down the block again. Now he takes his time walking up;
                she has her back to him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>menacingly</sd> Don't come any closer</sp>

            <sd>He stops.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>What's the matter? Afraid of the
                light?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to behind her on the end of this line. Snarling with pure rage, she swirls to
                her feet. Her eyes are glowing red rather than the usual white when she uses her
                powers. Pull back; she grows to an impossible height, at least three times as tall
                as Doctor Light, and thick black tendrils shoot toward him from under her cloak. He
                cries out in shock.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr><sd>fearfully, backing up</sd> No! No
                    <sd>He is seized and pulled in; sparks fly from him.</sd> My suit! What are
                you--? No, stop, you win, I surrender!</sp>

            <sd>Too late. He is dragged toward the billowing blue hem as Raven smiles viciously down
                at him. When she speaks, the voice sounds as if some demonic thing is saying the
                words along with her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>What's the matter? Afraid of the dark?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>I surrender! NOOOOOO!</sp>

            <sd>He is pulled in; Robin rushes over.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>RAVEN!! STOP!!</sp>

            <sd>Raven's eyes return to normal in a snap. She gasps sharply and shrinks back to
                normal size; her cloak recedes to reveal the beaten enemy, curled up in a fetal
                position on the pavement and shivering in wide-eyed fear. Robin and Starfire, out of
                her trap, run to comfort him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>It's okay. You're going to be all right.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>It was...no...so dark...make it
                stop...make it stop..</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy and Cyborg, free of the pavement, approach Raven.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Dude! Raven, what did you do?</sp>

            <sd>When she turns to face him, her eyes have again gone red and she is snarling as
                before. He backs up behind Cyborg with a scream; she quickly composes herself and
                stalks away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>What's her deal?</sp>

            <sd>She enters a dark alley and is soon lost to sight. Fade to black.</sd>

            <title>Act One</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the exterior of Titans Tower. It is now the following morning.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr><sd>from inside</sd> Rise and shine,
                amigos.</sp>

            <sd>Inside, he is cooking at the kitchen counter, while Cyborg, Starfire, and Robin are
                at the table. He has donned a chef's hat.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Breakfast is served</sp>

            <sd>He carries a steaming pan over.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Thanks, Beast Boy. Everything looks great</sp>

            <sd>It is set down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>On my planet, such a feast would mark the
                arrangement of a marriage. Tell me, Beast Boy, to whom are you engaged?</sp>

            <sd>Not quite ready to deal with a curveball like that so early in the day, Beast Boy
                shouts in surprise and jumps back. He has to catch his hat in order to keep it from
                flying across the room. Cyborg, meanwhile, has started wolfing down a plateful of
                food. When he finishes, he burps loudly and his expression changes to resemble that
                of a person who has just eaten a skunk. He spits the meal out disgustedly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's not eggs! That's that tofu stuff!</sp>

            <sd>He drains his glass to get the taste out of his mouth-but instead his whole head
                ends up looking as if it might explode. The drink goes the way of the food.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's not even real milk!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy gives him a reproving frown as the door opens and Raven enters the
                kitchen. She pays no mind to the breakfast table and heads for the counter.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Hey, Raven. Want breakfast?</sp>

            <sd>She picks up the coffeepot and pours a cup. Beast Boy pops up behind her with a full
                plate.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It's good. Wakey-wakey, tofu eggs and
                bakey.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Herbal tea.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Come on, just one little taste. You could use
                a little food after the way you cooked Doctor Light.</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of the back of her head on the end of this. She then whirls to face the
                camera, her eyes blazing red.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>NO!!</sp>

            <sd>The cook gasps in fear as she exerts her powers on the plate he holds. The eggs
                explode like a volcano, leaving him covered with his own cuisine. He makes a
                strangled little noise and drops the plate; she turns away and leaves through the
                side door, which closes behind her. Beast Boy stands there, holding the pan of food,
                as a vein throbs in his temple and Robin eases over.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Maybe you should go apologize.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Me? I'm not the one who just turned breakfast
                into a battlefield</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg joins them carrying his dishes.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Yeah, but after the weirdness that went down last
                night, you should know better than to go messing with her</sp>

            <sd>He heads for the sink.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I was trying to be nice <sd>Starfire comes
                    over.</sd> But no matter how hard I try, she still treats me like tofu eggs
                    <sd>Cyborg washes the dishes.</sd> You know, she's never once laughed at any of
                my jokes.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>'Least she listens. I just kinda tune you out.</sp>

            <sd>Sight gag: a little storm cloud appears briefly over the disgruntled green Titan's
                head.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Raven is complicated. There is much about her we
                are not meant to understand.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Then how are we supposed to deal with her? How
                can we even trust her? I mean--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>She's our friend. What more do we need to know?</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of Beast Boy, zooming in slowly; he puts the mental machinery to work
                trying to sort this one out. Dissolve to him in the hall, standing before a closed
                door and scratching his head. After a few seconds, cut to a closer shot; he gingerly
                raises one fist, turns his head away as if ready to avoid a sudden explosion, and
                just barely taps the door.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr><sd>shrugging</sd> Oh, well, nobody's
                home.</sp>

            <sd>He starts away, whistling. Pan to follow him until he runs flat into Cyborg, who has
                come up just behind him, and rubs his hurt nose.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Ow</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg glares down at him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You might want to knock a little louder.</sp>

            <sd>This is Raven's room, then. The big Titan plants a hand on the little one's
                shoulder, turns him to face the door, and walks him to it. A little shudder of fear
                comes from Beast Boy. Cyborg knocks, much louder than his colleague's feeble
                attempt; on the third and final knock, snap to black. The view is illuminated the
                entire door falls in, exposing them in the hall: we are now inside the room, and he
                has smashed the door off the hinges. Both faces go slack as a big drop of sweat
                rolls down Cyborg's temple.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Now we both have to apologize.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a pan across the quarters, proving beyond any doubt that Raven's tastes are
                about as dark as they come. Shelves filled with old books, four-eyed tragedy and
                comedy masks on a pedestal, oddly shaped mirror on the wall, chalices and braziers,
                ancient chests and lamps, a bed partly recessed into the far wall, a large globe in
                the near corner. The entire place is done in shades of gray and black. Back to the
                doorway.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh, Raven? Sorry about the door. Raven?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Dude, she's not here. Come on.</sp>

            <sd>He walks in and reaches the bookshelves and masks. Pan to follow him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Looks like Halloween came early this
                year.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c., whispering</sd> We're in Raven's room
                    <sd>walking into view</sd> We should not be in Raven's room. She doesn't let
                anybody in here, ever!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>So this is our big chance to find out more
                about her.</sp>

            <sd>He crosses the space. Cut to him at a dresser by the wall.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>For instance.. <sd>He laughs and picks up a
                    hand mirror, studying his image.</sd> ...check out this beauty mirror. Who
                woulda thought Raven spends time sprucing? Ah! Is that a zit?</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of the mirror; he pokes at a spot on his cheek. Suddenly, two pairs of
                glowing red eyes, one above the other, superimpose themselves on his image. They
                clear to leave him gasping in shock, and he drops the mirror and backs up with a cry
                of fear. A red-rimmed swath of black energy shoots straight up from the object,
                shapes itself into an arm, and grabs him. He is shaken back and forth as Cyborg pays
                no mind, having reached the doorway and made ready to leave.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Come on, B, we should really get out.. <sd>Beast Boy
                    is yanked away.</sd> ...huh?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the mirror, on the floor, and tilt up along the arm's length.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Yo!</sp>

            <sd>It starts to drag Beast Boy down, but Cyborg is there in one swift leap to grab an
                ankle. Both Titans are yanked through the looking glass, which returns to its normal
                appearance and gives off a small puff of smoke.</sd>

            <sd>Dissolve to within a whirlpool of dark-glowing energy. Yelling, Beast Boy and Cyborg
                are swept into view at the far end and careen toward the camera and o.c. Cut to a
                patch of outer space filled with red stars and a few large asteroids; a vortex opens
                over one of them and dumps the two Titans onto its surface. They stand up just in
                time to watch it close.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Oh, man</sp>

            <sd>Long shot of the asteroid.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I told you we shouldn't have gone in her room
                    <sd>Cyborg taps his forearm controls.</sd> Uh...where are we</sp>

            <sd>He walks around.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You're asking the wrong robot. My sensors must be on
                the blink, 'cause they're saying we're in Titans Tower.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Riiiight. So how do we get back</sp>

            <sd>Pause.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Guess we start walking.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Come on. I'm serious. We're on a rock in the
                middle of--</sp>

            <sd>The sound of something large shifting cuts him off. In the middle of the void,
                several fragments of rock rearrange themselves to form a winding path.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Oh <sd>They set out.</sd> If sending us to
                Weirdsville's Raven's idea of a joke, I am so not laughing.</sp>

            <sd>Pan slightly and refocus on a tree in the foreground. A raven sits on one
                branch.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Hey, she didn't send us here. You're the one who
                went snooping in her room and popping zits in her magic mirror.</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of the bird during this line. Like that strange reflection, it has two
                pairs of red eyes. Back to the two Titans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Who booby-traps a mirror?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Maybe it wasn't a trap. Maybe it's Raven's way home.
                Maybe this is where she's from.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Definitely creepy enough.</sp>

            <sd>They pivot for a look behind them, trying to locate the speaker.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Like I was saying...</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Voice">Voice</spkr>Turn back.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to a rocky arch over the path. Perched on it are three small black birds, each
                of which shows a pair of large red eyes to the camera. One at a time, they repeat
                the two-word instruction and continue under the next line.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Sweet! Betcha they can tell us how to get
                home</sp>

            <sd>Pan; he passes Cyborg.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Careful. How do we know they're not a threat</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy reaches the arch.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Hel-lo? Remember me? Beast Boy? If they were
                dangerous, I'd know.</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg is not a bit convinced that this guy knows what he is doing. Said guy turns
                to the arch and adopts the sort of tone one might use with a small kitten.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Hey, little guys. My buddy and I were
                wondering if--</sp>

            <sd>Tilt up to the arch on the end of this; the birds are gone. When the camera tilts
                down again, five of them have gathered at his feet. "Turn back" is repeated over and
                over during a pan across them in close-up. The beaks suddenly elongate and sprout
                small sharp teeth, and each eye splits into two smaller ones to match the raven seen
                earlier. Their snarls are met with a surprised cry from Beast Boy, who turns and
                runs smack into Cyborg; the former tumbles o.c. while the latter crashes down on the
                stones.</sd>

            <sd>The birds, now multiplied into a flock of ravens, fly past Cyborg and zero in on the
                skidding shape-shifter. He turns into a hippopotamus and opens wide, and three of
                them perch on his tongue. Snap go the jaws; the prey squirms inside, and after a
                moment, he has to open his mouth again and shake them off, they have clamped their
                beaks onto the lingual muscle. Cyborg, faring no better, shouts as he tries to beat
                off the attackers.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me <sd>runs o.c.; they
                    follow</sd> Cut it out!</sp>

            <sd>Back and forth they go. Beast Boy, as an ostrich, followed by Cyborg, then the
                flock. The flock, dodging a sonic cannon shot, then Cyborg riding Beast Boy in llama
                form and firing away. One dodges a few shots and buzzes past him; he hunches down
                over his mount and fires another round. We then see the creature fly low, and in
                response Cyborg growls and blasts straight down at it. Fractured by the energy, the
                stone path starts to crumble away; the two Titans trade the classic "uh-oh" look and
                Beast Boy's ears droop sadly just before they drop out of sight. Cut to the broken
                edge of the path, seen from below, and pull back. Cyborg has one hand buried in
                Beast Boy's pelt and the other dug into the broken rock. Close-up; he starts to haul
                the green animal up, but a very familiar voice stops him cold, not so much the
                speaker, but the tone.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c., cheerfully</sd> Hey, guys.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back a bit. On the underside of the path, she can be seen from the knees down.
                However, her boots and cloak are bright pink rather than the usual blue, and the
                cloak does not hang down as it would if a person stood on his head. Cut to Cyborg's
                perspective; she is hanging upside down with no ill effects whatsoever, and she
                waves. Her wristbands have also gone pink.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr>What's up</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of Cyborg.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>in a small voice</sd> I don't know anymore.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back to frame all three. The camera turns 180 degrees to put Raven right side
                up and the two interlopers upside down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Whoa!</sp>

            <sd>He and Beast Boy slam down onto the path. Raven giggles as the latter stands up,
                back in human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Raven?! How did, where are, what just-- <sd>A
                    question mark pops up by his head.</sd> Why are you wearing pink?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr><sd>giggling</sd> 'Cause it's my favorite
                color.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It is</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg gets up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Look, I'd love to talk fashion, but I don't suppose
                you know how to get home.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr>The Forbidden Door.</sp>

            <sd>Pan slightly to put her out of view and frame the rest of the path, which runs under
                a couple of other arches and stops at a distant asteroid.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> It's the only way out,
                but you don't want to go there <sd>Back to the three.</sd> Not now.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy and Cyborg">Beast Boy and Cyborg</spkr><sd>glance at each other
                    and speak in unison</sd> Uh...yeah, we do.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr>'Kay, but don't say I didn't warn ya.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the nearest arch. Making airplane sounds and stretching her arms out like
                wings, she runs through it and down the path.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Have you ever seen her this
                happy</sp>

            <sd>He and Beast Boy walk after her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Dude, I didn't even know Raven could do
                happy.</sp>

            <sd>Their images fade away. Cut to a peaceful-looking landscape under a bright yellow
                sky; a stone arch springs overhead, and they appear beneath it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Now where are we?</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to a long overhead shot and pull back slowly. A path goes on and on,
                threading through that arch and bisecting a huge meadow filled with pink grass and
                trees. Fade to black.</sd>

        </act>
        <act n="2">
            <title>Act Two</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the serene pink landscape and yellow sky. A small strawberry floats
                past the path; follow it over to two extremely bewildered Titans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I think this might be where air fresheners
                come from.</sp>

            <sd>Giggling from o.c.; pan to bring Pink Raven into view next to them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr>Good one!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You're laughing?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>At one of my jokes?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#PinkRaven">Pink Raven</spkr>Sure. I've always thought you were funny,
                BB. But hey, looks aren't everything.</sp>

            <sd>Laughing even harder now, she takes her leave of them. Cut to the exterior of the
                Tower and zoom in toward the roof.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr><sd>from the roof</sd> Raven...</sp>

            <sd>Cut to her, meditating up there.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> ...you okay? We stopped by your
                room and the door's been knocked down.</sp>

            <sd>He and Starfire come up behind her on the end of this. Raven's eyes pop open, wide
                as saucers, and she laughs uncontrollably for a few seconds. The sound scares the
                other two Titans out of their wits; she cuts it off by clapping both hands over her
                mouth.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>blushing profusely</sd> Need to be alone.</sp>

            <sd>She stands up and hurries to the door leading to the stairs/elevator. The camera
                placement makes it almost appear as if she passes through the barrier.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr><sd>to Robin</sd> Many of your Earthly ways are
                still strange to me, but that was...just plain freaky. Correct?</sp>

            <sd>Cut to just inside the wrecked door of her room. She looks in around the frame,
                enters, and puts the wall back in order with an easy motion of the hand. Walking in
                a bit farther, she stops short at the hand mirror on the floor.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>horrified</sd> No.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the pink meadow; the camera points down from the treetops, where a few
                four-eyed ravens have perched. Pan to bring Beast Boy and Cyborg into view, making
                their way along the path that runs on and on toward an arch that looks very much
                like the one they started at.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>She ditched us! I can't believe Raven ditched
                us! Next time I see her, it's not gonna be pretty.</sp>

            <sd>As he says this, the scenery dissolves to the outer-space region they were in
                before. They are back on the winding stone path. Cut to a long shot and pull back
                briefly, then back to them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Hey, I know where we are! We're in that place where
                I didn't know where we were before.</sp>

            <sd>Raven pops up in front of them, her back to us, and startles the daylights out of
                them. Her cloak is now gray; cut to a close-up, revealing a very sad and fearful
                facial expression.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr><sd>furiously</sd> Where were you? Shopping
                for robes?!</sp>

            <sd>Sight gag: his head grows a few sizes and flushes an angry red, with a vein standing
                out on his temple, and she shrinks to midget size in his shadow and starts to cry.
                The two quickly return to normal size as her tears stop.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Whoa. Easy <sd>Cut to them.</sd> I didn't mean
                it. Please don't--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Hey!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to him. He points ahead down the path toward the asteroid at the end; they are
                closer now.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's that Forbidden Door, right, Raven <sd>She
                    nods worriedly; Cyborg starts to run.</sd> Come on, y'all! We're almost--</sp>

            <sd>A high metal wall springs up from the stone surface to block his rush.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Whoa!</sp>

            <sd>More walls emerge to box in the trio. Dissolve to an overhead view of the area; a
                large maze has assembled itself here, ad the camera tilts up to show it filling much
                of the stretch leading to the asteroid. Inside, Beast Boy turns into a falcon and
                flies up toward the open top of the labyrinth. Just as he is about to surmount the
                walls, a force field crackles to life and sends him crashing to the ground. He sits
                up in human form and rubs his head.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Great</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg breaks out his cannon.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Oh, man, we gotta get outta here!</sp>

            <sd>He fires a few bursts at the walls, but it does not even put a scratch on them. Gray
                Raven speaks up for the first time; her voice matches her expression perfectly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GrayRaven">Gray Raven</spkr>It's a maze. You can't get out. You have to
                go through. I can show you the way, but when we reach the end, you won't like me
                anymore <sd>looks at Beast Boy</sd> He already doesn't like me.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Come on. That's not...</sp>

            <sd>She has already started down the way. The two boys stare after her with a fair bit
                of irritation.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Gee, Raven, moody much?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Yeah, she's like a whole different person.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to another part of the convoluted architecture. Gray Raven's voice is heard
                from around a corner shortly before she walks into view.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GrayRaven">Gray Raven</spkr>And...remember the time I called you both
                immature pinheads? I'm sorry for that, too. And also, the-</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg and Beast Boy round the corner.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>For the hundredth, millionth time...</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy and Cyborg">Beast Boy and Cyborg</spkr><sd>lean toward the
                    camera and speak in unison</sd> ...we forgive you!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Gray Raven, who has stopped at a wall. She waves timidly toward it, and it
                slides open like a pair of interlocking doors to reveal a short path that leads out
                of the maze. Tilt up, putting her out of view, to show two tall stone statues
                positioned to either side. They wear long cloaks and have faces that match the masks
                in Raven's room. Each has only one arm, on the side toward the wall next to it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GrayRaven">Gray Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> That's the end</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the three.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Sweet!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>All right, Raven!</sp>

            <sd>They head for the egress, but she does not join them. The eyes of the smiling statue
                glow red, followed by those of the frowning one, and they slam together back to
                back. Three quick half-turns put the smile in view, then the frown, then the smile
                again. Close-up of each hand in turn; long swords materialize in them, and when the
                camera pulls back, we see that the double sculpture has now grown a second set of
                arms.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>What?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>No way</sp>

            <sd>Cyborg groans.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GrayRaven">Gray Raven</spkr>Told you you wouldn't like me when we got
                here.</sp>

            <sd>She drops out of sight, but the guys have no time to worry about her; the stone
                giant is advancing toward them. Suddenly, the screen fills with static and resolves
                to a view of a screaming man running from a huge green monster. More static, which
                clears to show a chef working in his kitchen.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Chef">Chef</spkr>Now the salt.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back into the operations center; this is a show Robin is watching on the
                window/screen, as was the previous clip. He lounges on the couch while Starfire
                paces behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Chef">Chef</spkr>Stir continuously until thickened.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Robin. He works the remote; from the TV's direction, a Western starts
                up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>May we go see if she is feeling better?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>She said she wanted to be alone.</sp>

            <sd>Another click, and the screen again fills with static. It clears to give a view of
                the end of the outer-space path; tilt down to Cyborg and Beast Boy, who back
                nervously along it. The sound of swords being drawn is heard, and here comes that
                sculpture guardian with both blades ready to go. As it bears down on them, Beast Boy
                becomes a falcon and flies away, and Cyborg lets loose a blast from his cannon that
                does no damage. A sword clangs down on the stone next to him. That green falcon
                swoops down, talons extended, only to be caught in one of the two free hands and
                squeezed cruelly. It changes back into Beast Boy as Raven's voice is heard once
                again, but this time, she sounds radically different.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c., spoiling for a fight</sd> Yo!
                Eight-Eyes!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to her, launching a flying kick. Her cloak is now green.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GreenRaven">Green Raven</spkr>Hai-yah!</sp>

            <sd>The kick slashes across the statue's head and sends it toppling to the ground.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GreenRaven">Green Raven</spkr>Whoo-hoo! In your faces!</sp>

            <sd>She leaps at the foe, now back on its feet, and dodges one sword slash after another
                without changing the little smirk on her face. Up she goes, index and middle fingers
                of one hand extended together, and brings them straight down the length of the rock
                body. Smoke billows out to follow the trace; cut to a close-up of the surface, which
                breaks apart along the new cleavage. The two halves drop away, leaving Cyborg and
                Beast Boy staring in pure amazement at this new incarnation of their fellow
                Titan.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#GreenRaven">Green Raven</spkr>Hoo-ah! High fives! Come on!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy stares a bit more, his jaw slack, and then shakes his head vigorously to
                clear it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>What is your deal?! First, you nuke
                breakfast.. <sd>Cut to the trees, full of red-eyed ravens; he continues o.c.</sd>

                all weepy, and now you're a Marine? Make up your mind. Who are you?</sp>

            <sd>Green Raven directs a quizzical look at him as grinning Pink leaps into view and
                glum Gray slinks up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Green, Gray, and Pink Ravens">Green, Gray, and Pink Ravens</spkr><sd>all

                You forgot dopey.</sp>

            <sd>She laughs, but Cyborg is thinking very hard and starting to figure a few things
                out.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Different sides of Raven's personality. We're not in
                Raven's home.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>from o.c., normal tone</sd> And I want you
                out.</sp>

            <sd>The blue-cloaked girl drops into view in front of her three duplicates, who fade
                away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>The mirror you found is for meditation. It's a portal
                into my MIND, NOT A TOY!</sp>

            <sd>The last four words are aimed at Beast Boy and spoken through gritted teeth. A big
                drop of sweat rolls down his face. Pull back to the treetops; the ravens are still
                watching.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr><sd>chuckling</sd> My bad.</sp>

            <sd>The birds fly away in a great commotion of squawking and flapping wings.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You have to go, now.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Hold up. What's going on here</sp>

            <sd>Close-up of her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Last night, something...got loose. Something bad.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Oh, no, you don't <sd>Pull
                    back to frame him.</sd> I've had it with this mystery-girl routine. I want to
                know exactly what we're talking about here.</sp>

            <sd>There is an unholy roaring from o.c. Cut to a gargantuan black vortex that has
                formed over the horizon; the ravens are flying into it. Gradually, this retreats
                from the top down to expose a super-king-sized humanoid male with red skin, flowing
                white hair, and four glowing yellow eyes. He is clad in a black and gray loincloth,
                steel wristbands, and a belt similar to the one Raven wears, as well as a jewel on
                his forehead. The belt is silver, set with black stones, and a matching piece is set
                at the throat to match her brooch. There are short, curved black stripes on the arms
                and chest. This is Raven's father, the demon Trigon.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Trigon">Trigon</spkr>Hatred shall rule.</sp>

            <sd>His voice is the same as the one overlaid with Raven's when she snared Doctor Light
                at the beginning of the episode. Tilt down to the horizon; he also wears shin guards
                to match his wristbands. Raven and the boys stare up at his sheer size.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>as all three back up</sd> Let's just say I have
                issues with my father.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Trigon, who moves steadily ahead and leans down with a roar, giving the
                camera an extreme close-up of his face. Fade to black.</sd>

        </act>
        <act n="3">
            <title>Act Three</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the three Titans standing before Trigon. Tilt up to his head, he
                roars, throwing a scare into all of them. Beast Boy and Cyborg turn to run, but
                Raven holds her ground. A quadruple blast from those glowing eyes hits the ground
                just in front of her, forcing her to jump clear. Those enormous feet stomp down the
                path after Cyborg and Beast Boy, who are making a beeline for a portal set into the
                base of a rock formation: the Forbidden Door. A beam hits just in front of them and
                brings that plan to a very abrupt halt. Raven drops into view facing Trigon.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</sp>

            <sd>She creates a shield around herself, the boys, and the Door; daddy not-so-dearest
                unleashes another blast that cuts a long furrow in the stone as it races toward her.
                So much rock and dust is thrown up that we cannot see whether her barrier is
                holding. The screen fills with static, Robin is changing channels again. Stop
                briefly on a tropical waterfall, then flip to a man and a woman about to kiss, then
                cut to him on the couch, the remote in his hand. Starfire pops up behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>May we now go see if Raven is better?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>She wants to be alone.</sp>

            <sd>Another flip brings jungle sounds from the TV's direction; irked, she turns away.
                Cut to a profile close-up of Trigon; he fires another eye beam, and the camera pulls
                back to a long overhead shot of the area. Raven's shield is indeed holding up.
                Close-up of her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>with great effort</sd> Get out of my mind!
                Now!</sp>

            <sd>Pan to Cyborg and Beast Boy. The Door has now filled with a whirlpool just like the
                one that carried them into this place to begin with.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>And leave you alone with that?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Not gonna happen.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>It's my problem. I'll deal with it. If I lose, you'll
                be stuck in here forever.</sp>

            <sd>Pulling his hands back, Trigon produces a ball of energy between them and swings it
                forward to throw a mighty burst at his daughter. It breaches the shield, and a
                second shot blows it apart altogether. There is a great cloud of dust, which clears
                to show her still on her feet, arms crossed to protect her head. She swings one hand
                behind her in a sudden lash of telekinesis.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Go!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy and Cyborg are flung screaming toward the portal, but skid to a stop just
                short of its mouth. She flies up toward his level and fires a black salvo from her
                hand, annoying him enough to make him start trying to swat her down. Her evasive
                maneuvers make this a rather tougher prospect than it might seem at first; his next
                eye blast also hits nothing. The two fellows watch, then look at the exit, and
                finally trade a knowing look.</sd>

            <sd>The free-for-all continues. Raven dodges Trigon's attempt to crush her between his
                palms and lands a shot on his chest. She is behind his head in the briefest instant,
                but he whirls and scores a direct hit that drops her like a rock. He catches her,
                knocked senseless, in one broad hand.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Trigon">Trigon</spkr>Rage shall consume you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Yo!</sp>

            <sd>Pull back; he is standing on a nearby mountain ledge and has his cannon locked and
                loaded.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Sounds like somebody needs a time-out.</sp>

            <sd>His blast is blocked when the demon raises a forearm, but with the chest left wide
                open, a second shot finds its mark. Trigon stumbles backward, letting go of Raven,
                and topples over the edge of the asteroid into empty space. Raven tumbles helplessly
                toward a high-speed hello with a granite slab, but Beast Boy, as a falcon, is diving
                down at top speed. Close-up of her; his talons close on her shoulder, and she starts
                to come around with a barely audible moan. Pull back to ground level. He sets her
                down safely, leaving her to fall to her knees with a small groan, and drops back
                next to her in human form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You stayed? I thought you didn't like me.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Thought you didn't like me</sp>

            <sd>She smiles.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Yo, I like both of you <sd>Cut to
                    him.</sd> Now get your butts over here!</sp>

            <sd>A growling Trigon rises slowly over the ridge behind him. Pull back and tilt up as
                he gets fully erect and raises his arms.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Trigon">Trigon</spkr>Feel my fury!</sp>

            <sd>A four-pack of eye blasts blows up the ground at Cyborg's feet and sends him diving
                for cover. Raven and Beast Boy both take to the air; he as a pterodactyl, to
                continue the offensive and get backup from their partner's cannon. He bobs and
                weaves through the barren landscape to dodge the blazing bursts and returns fire as
                he is able. The last round gets Trigon good and mad; close-up of him as he leans
                down to hit the big man point-blank. Before he can deliver that finishing stroke,
                though, he yells in surprise and his head is pulled backward. Cut to behind him,
                revealing that Beast Boy has wrapped his talons around that mane of white hair and
                started hauling back with all his strength. Trigon is dragged off balance to crash
                down among the rocky peaks, but is soon sitting up to shoot at Beast Boy, who flies
                away.</sd>

            <sd>The screen fills with static and then cuts to Robin on the couch. Once again,
                Starfire eases her head up behind him. The sound of a baseball game comes from the
                TV's direction.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>May we now--?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>No!</sp>

            <sd>She drops out of sight with a groan, and he works the remote again. More static,
                which resolves to Cyborg on the run from Trigon's fusillade. Beast Boy flies
                overhead and picks him up as Raven passes them both. The scarlet leviathan waves
                away the dust, looks around a bit, and moves away; tilt down to the group huddled
                behind a small ridge. Beast Boy is human again.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>He's too strong. Even with your help, I cannot defeat
                him.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>So call for backup! What about all those other
                you's?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Yeah, the green one kinda kicked butt.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>It still wouldn't be enough. None of my other sides
                have the kind of power we need.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Not alone, but what about together
                    <sd>Trigon's footsteps approach.</sd> They're all part of who you are,
                right?</sp>

            <sd>The camera shakes as dust floats down around them. Cyborg peeks over the ridge and
                sees the demonic figure nearby. A couple of eye blasts send the Titan ducking back
                behind the rocks.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Go for it! We got your back.</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy gives her an encouraging nod and runs after Cyborg to assist in the
                diversion. A small smile crosses her face and then disappears as she closes her eyes
                and begins to concentrate. Her hood is down at this point, but a dissolve shows her
                with it up. Opening her eyes, she crosses her arms in front of herself as the camera
                pulls back; a sudden gust of wind stirs the dust at her feet, and her duplicates
                rise from the ground. One of them is so close that her cloak blacks out the screen.
                Fade in to no fewer than six Ravens in cloaks of pink, gray, green, yellow, brown,
                and lavender. Yellow Raven wears glasses, perhaps representing her cerebral aspect.
                Well after the arrival of this group, a seventh alter ego pops up, clad in an orange
                cloak. She digs something out of her ear, opens her eyes sleepily, and burps;
                Raven's lazy side.</sd>

            <sd>They scatter; cut to Raven as they form a large circle around her. All eight rise
                into the air and hover several feet above the ground, and the seven doubles start to
                spin about her center point, faster and faster until they are visible only as
                colored blurs. The formation gradually turns white, sucking up a little grit due to
                the airspeed, and the whole screen is washed out from the brilliance, except for
                Raven's form, which can be seen fuzzily at the center.</sd>

            <sd>A huge flash puts the camera near Beast Boy and Cyborg, the latter firing his cannon
                at will. Trigon counters with a storm of bird apparitions from his hand; Beast Boy
                turns into a pterodactyl again and takes to the air. Cyborg is quickly beset by the
                flapping things and loses control of his shots. The giant smiles evilly down at him
                and does not notice Raven rising behind his own head; her tightly wrapped cloak now
                pure white. He swivels to look her full in the face, and the wind blows her garment
                open to reveal that her outfit is also white instead of black.</sd>

            <sd>White Raven hurls a mass of black energy, which forms itself into a band that
                encircles Trigon tightly from shoulders to waist. Her next words take on a very deep
                and terrible tone.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#WhiteRaven">White Raven</spkr>You are going back where you belong!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Trigon">Trigon</spkr>Never!</sp>

            <sd>He breaks loose of her binding spell. She rises into the air, arms crossed in front,
                and her eyes and mouth start to blaze with the same dark force that pours from her
                hands. Cut to Trigon and pull back; he sends two huge beams from his hands toward
                her. The two energies meet at a point between them and cancel out; it becomes a
                tug-of-war, with the balance point shifting back and forth between them. Beast Boy,
                back in human form, and Cyborg have their hands full trying to keep those birds from
                pecking them to mush, but they suddenly disappear.</sd>

            <sd>The standoff between White Raven and Trigon continues, with the former slowly
                gaining ground. One final groaning effort sends her beam surging into his face;
                there is an incredible flash when it hits, and the screen clears to show that he has
                turned into another copy of her, with red eyes and a dark red cloak. Red Raven drops
                to the ground in front of the white-clad real thing, revealing herself to be perhaps
                a foot tall, and raises her head to expose two pairs of those glowing eyes. Her body
                disintegrates into a bolt of energy that crackles into White Raven's, throwing her
                into an unbearable rictus.</sd>

            <sd>One final flash leaves the screen filled with smoke, which clears to show only the
                Titan standing on a rock-back in her normal blue cloak and bowed as if she has just
                taken the beating of a lifetime. As she straightens up, the wind reveals her black
                outfit beneath. A moment later, she moans weakly and collapses backward only to be
                caught by Cyborg and Beast Boy.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>We gotcha.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It's okay</sp>

            <sd>They set her on her feet; she blushes.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>rubs her head</sd> Thank you...friends.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>So...we really are friends?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>her smile fades</sd> Don't push it.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to the exterior of the Tower; it is now nighttime. Close-up of Starfire's
                hand inside, straining toward a door to knock, with Robin's fingers wrapped around
                her arm to pull it back.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> Please! Let us simply-</sp>

            <sd>He pulls her back.</sd>

            <sd>Pull back to frame them on the end of this. They are outside the door to Raven's
                room.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>She could be weeping and--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I don't want to bother her</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr><sd>from o.c.</sd> But if we merely--</sp>

            <sd>The door opens. Head-on view of the two; she relaxes with a gasp and smiles, and he
                tumbles backward to the floor. Pull back to frame the entire doorway, in which
                Cyborg, Beast Boy, and Raven are now standing. Robin gets to his feet.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Where have you guys been?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Just getting to know each other</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Come, friends. We shall prepare a new breakfast
                feast.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It's a little late for breakfast, Star. Maybe
