            <title>Prologue</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: a night sky filled with dark thunderhead clouds. Flashes of lightning
                illuminate their contours. A bulky silhouette stands up among them and begins to
                swing a pair of sticks against the clouds; every time it brings them down, there is
                another strike and accompanying thunderclap. Dissolve to another patch of the sky,
                where even more lightning crackles back and forth. A second silhouette, this one
                much thinner and with spiky upswetpt hair, stands up and directs its hands here and
                there. There is a new flare-up every time it does so.</sd>

            <sd>When the last one clears, the camera has moved to a point near the underside of the
                clouds as the flashes continue from within. There is a huge strike, and the camera
                pulls back to put Titans Tower in view. Inside, in the hall, Beast Boy has become a
                buffalo and is straining mightily at a rubber band looped over his horns, trying to
                catch it on a nearby hook. He succeeds and ducks away, coming up in human form with
                a mischievous smile on his face. Now he produces a large, filled water balloon that
                sloshes a bit in his hands, and he lets off a wicked little chuckle.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>This is gonna be so sweet!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>What are you doing?</sp>

            <sd>Surprised by her words, he lets go of the balloon and completely freaks out as he
                tries desperately to make a safe catch. Finally, he gets hold of it and turns
                around, and the camera pans to show Raven behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Please tell me this isn't another ridiculous
                prank.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Okay. It's not a ridiculous prank. It's a
                brilliant one!</sp>

            <sd>He laughs. Close-up of her, rolling her eyes wearily.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>All right, check it out<sd>Pull back to frame both.</sd>'Member
                how Cyborg put red dye in my shampoo and I turned brown for two days? Well, sister,
                it's payback time.</sp>

            <sd>A thought balloon appears above his head as he describes the situation. It shows, in
                "Super Deformed" style, the hapless victim-tinted brown, holding a scrub brush, in
                towel, shower cap, and slippers, standing there while the other SD Titans scroll
                past and laugh at him. The balloon disappears as he finishes; now a pull string
                hangs down from the ceiling, and he reaches for it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I give you...the Beast Boy Insta-Lube
                9000!</sp>

            <sd>As he says this, he pulls the string and he and Raven back up o.c. Down comes a
                blueprint that fills most of the screen; the words "Beast Boy" and "Insta-Lube"
                slide in beneath it, after which "9000" drops from the lower edge and replaces them.
                The diagram shows the rubber band, which is part of a floor-mounted slingshot, held
                back by the hook and with the balloon loaded in. A tripwire in front of the rig runs
                through overhead pulleys and is tied to a lever that is in turn connected to the
                hook.</sd>

            <sd>The lower portion of the screen dissolves to a shot of the hall and zooms in on the
                tripwire, and on the blueprint, a rough figure of Cyborg steps up and catches his
                foot there.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>

                lever...</sp>

            <sd>Blueprint: it moves forward and pops the band loose. Lower portion: zoom in on the
                attachment point.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>voice over</sd>...the lever releases the mother of all rubber bands...</sp>

            <sd>Blueprint: the balloon sails toward Cyborg in slow motion. Lower portion: Raven
                walks over to the setup, and Beast Boy pops into view with the ammo.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>loading it in</sd>...which sends a balloon, load of motor oil flying right at
                him, and BOOSH<sd>The blueprint rolls back up on this last word.</sd>Pretty clever,
                huh?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You're a genius.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It's just a little good clean dirty fun.</sp>

            <sd>A door opens o.c.; he perks up his ears to listen.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Here he comes</sp>

            <sd>He ducks away, then back to whisk her off.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Whoa<sd>They hide around a corner.</sd>I do not
                think--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Shhh!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>But what if--?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Shhh</sp>

            <sd>Long silence.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c., whispering</sd>Why are we hiding?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Shhh!</sp>

            <sd>His eyes instantly go as wide as saucers upon realizing that his target is nowhere
                near ground zero, and the camera pulls back as he flips out for a moment. Cyborg is
                hunched down behind both of them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Cyborg?! You can't be Cyborg!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>I can't?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>pointing at him, then into hall</sd>If you're you, then who's...?</sp>

            <sd>Footsteps echo out there as all three look out. Cut to a shot down the way, the
                camera positioned just behind the oil-filled balloon, then to an extreme close-up of
                the tripwire. A violet boot steps into view and catches it, the string is pulled
                taut, the lever moves, and the hook starts to pull away from the rubber band. Cut to
                in front of the balloon, which is released as Beast Boy jumps out in a frantic
                attempt to stop it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>NOOOOOOOO!!</sp>

            <sd>Audio and video both shift to slow motion as the projectile is propelled forward by
                the tension. Just as he is about to run into the camera, cut to a long shot of
                Starfire and zoom in to an extreme close-up of her face. She is so taken by surprise
                that she literally cannot see straight.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>normal speed</sd>Eek!</sp>

            <sd>Pull back to show the balloon right in front of her; it collides with her face,
                splattering her with the viscous contents, and knocks her onto her back. Normal
                speed: Beast Boy runs up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Starfire!</sp>

            <sd>She has propped herself up on her hands, but cannot see him due to all the oil
                covering her eyes. Cyborg and Raven come over.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You okay</sp>

            <sd>She gets her eyes open.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>puzzled</sd>This is punishment? I did something wrong</sp>

            <sd>Cut to Raven and Cyborg.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You didn't. He did.</sp>

            <sd>Pan from them to Beast Boy, who gives a sheepish grin-accompanied by a sheep's
                bleating.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Star! It was..<sd>Cut to her; he continues
                    o.c.</sd>...you weren't supposed to...</sp>

            <sd>Back to him on the end of this. He starts to say something else, but when the camera
                cuts to Cyborg and Raven, their disapproving stares stop him in his tracks for a
                moment.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>I didn't..<sd>Pull back to frame him; he trails off and
                    laughs.</sd>Just remember to change that oil every three thousand miles.</sp>

            <sd>He tries to laugh again, but it dies on his lips. Starfire stands up and leans over
                him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>with steadily building rage</sd>On my planet, we have a name for those who do
                such terrible things. You are a...a...CLORBAG VARBLERNELK!!</sp>

            <sd>Sight gag: her head grows in stages until it is many times normal size, and he
                shrinks a few notches before it. The oil disappears from her face on the last two
                words. From here, cut to a close-up of Cyborg, very worried. The sight gag has now
                ended.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>I'm a what-bag</sp>

            <sd>Tilt down to him, in front of Cyborg.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>You heard the lady.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>
                <sd>shaking her head</sd>You are such a clorbag.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Come on, you guys. Can't anybody take a
                joke</sp>

            <sd>A flash of lightning interrupts the standoff.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Titans<sd>Cut to him, silhouetted against the glare.</sd>
                Trouble!</sp>

            <sd>The next strike illuminates him fully and leaves the screen black when it
                dissipates.</sd>

            <cue>OPENING THEME</cue>

        </act>
        <act n="1">
            <title>Act One</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: the bridge across Jump City Bay. Lighting flashes among the storm
                clouds and finally strikes the roadway. Overhead view of the blast, then cut to a
                big rig on the bridge. The driver yells in surprise and cuts his wheels sharply to
                the right, braking as he does so; the truck stops just short of the smoking, flaming
                strike point. Many cars slam on their brakes to avoid a collision, creating an
                instant traffic jam.</sd>

            <sd>As the smoke starts to clear, the two silhouettes seen among the clouds become
                visible within it. The last wisps evaporate to give a fully detailed view of both;
                they wear outfits that look like something like samurai armor, but without the upper
                body protection. The bulky one has blue skin and black clothing trimmed with blue,
                and he also wears a samurai-style helmet. A thundercloud is emblazoned on his chest,
                and he has long black sideburns. His thin cohort, on the other hand, has light
                yellow skin and hair, and his outfit is red and yellow, with a lightning bolt on the
                chest. A headband keeps his hair out of the way and has a guard plate stretching
                down on either side to cover his cheeks. Both wear armbands and wrist/shin guards.
                We have just met Thunder and Lightning.</sd>

            <sd>The two new arrivals look at each other and smile; close-up of Thunder.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>May we have fun here, brother</sp>

            <sd>Pan to Lightning.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Of course<sd>creating a bolt between his
                    hands</sd>We are Thunder and Lightning. We may do whatever we please!</sp>

            <sd>He throws the bolt upward. Cut to one of the bridge's columns, where the suspension
                cables are connected, seen from roadway level. It is struck, and sparks fly
                everywhere.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Look, brother! I command the sparks to dance!</sp>

            <sd>He laughs as the strike dies out and the camera tilts down to them; the flickering
                remains fall all around in a shower.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Amusing. Now listen as I make music!</sp>

            <sd>He claps his hands, creating an intense shock wave, and the camera pulls back a
                distance to show it radiating outward. The bridge cables are jarred loose and begin
                to whipsaw back and forth. Cut to the semi, which gets a smoking lightning bolt
                traced into its side. Pan to the pair on the next line.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Let all who pass this way know Lightning was
                here!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>And Thunder, too!</sp>

            <sd>He bangs his fists together, knuckle to knuckle, and creates an earthquake that sets
                the stopped cars and their drivers trembling; all the alarm systems are set off in
                the process. The brothers laugh, and Thunder pats Lightning's shoulder.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Most amusing.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Hate to break it to you...</sp>

            <sd>Surprised, they look toward the traffic snarl; cut to the truck, where the Titans
                are standing on the trailer.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>...but you guys have a lousy sense of humor! This
                ends now!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>shakes his fist</sd>No one gives orders to Thunder and Lightning<sd>warms
                    up</sd>Taste my power!</sp>

            <sd>He throws a bolt at the truck and just misses the Titans, who scramble in five
                different directions. The trailer gets a big hole blown through it, wiping out his
                graffiti. Starfire does a U-turn and swoops down on him with starbolts blazing; he
                jumps onto a line of stopped cars, she does likewise, and they run on these parallel
                tracks and trade shots. The firefight continues for several dozen yards until he
                gets in a lucky hit that knocks her down.</sd>

            <sd>His brother, meanwhile, is mixing it up with Cyborg. They block or dodge a few of
                each other's punches and start to grapple. Close-up of Thunder's left fist, which he
                pulls back and readies for a powerful strike, then of Cyborg's right as he
                reconfigures it into the sonic cannon. Pull back to frame both; the fists swing and
                connect with each other, and the camera pulls back farther as the resulting shock
                wave throws them far down the bridge in opposite directions. Cyborg lands on his
                back, but Thunder brings a small cloud to himself and hops onto it to float
                upward.</sd>

            <sd>Robin finds the big blue hooligan bearing down on him and has to dodge a
                thunderclap. He leaps onto a guardrail, but another blast destroys that section and
                he has to move down a bit. The next attack breaks a support cable; he grabs the
                swinging free end and is carried away an instant before Thunder obliterates that
                section of the rail. Robin is carried high into the air before the cable starts to
                descend. He times his next move carefully and hurls himself over Thunder, avoiding a
                punch and grabbing the foe's shoulders to throw him across the pavement.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to Lightning, throwing a bolt.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Ha!</sp>

            <sd>Midair; Raven dodges the shot and launches herself downward for a flying kick. The
                yellow brother throws up his arms to block and is driven backward by her flurry of
                attacks. Finally, he gets clear and shocks her with a bolt that sends her flying. No
                sooner is she down, though, then Beast Boy, as a giant panda, lumbers up behind and
                catches him in a bear hug. Lightning struggles for a moment, then electrifies his
                entire body and gives the shape-shifting Titan a few hundred thousand volts. The
                shock forces him back into human form and causes him to let go.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>laughing</sd>Your powers are strong, but mine are stronger!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy, lying against a chunk of debris, groans and rubs his head for several
                seconds. He then gasps as Thunder's shadow falls over him; a flash of lightning, and
                the camera has shifted to the big blue one.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Your power of the animals is impressive, green

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Why are you doing this</sp>

            <sd>He stands up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Because it is not sporting to attack an unready
                opponent.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>No. Why are you wrecking everything?</sp>

            <sd>Pan in that direction to show the scared motorists huddling behind their damaged and
                overturned cars. The answer to that question is obvious. Back to Thunder and Beast
                Boy.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>I--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>This isn't funny! It's wrong!</sp>

            <sd>An attack of conscience makes Thunder relax his power. Before Beast Boy can say
                anything more, though, a lightning bolt blasts him away and its shooter jumps down
                next to his brother.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Ah, the thrill of victory<sd>puts his arm
                    around Thunder's shoulders</sd>Come, Thunder. We shall seek more amusement.</sp>

            <sd>They take to the air. Pan to a pile of rubble, from which the blasted Titan sits up,
                dazed, smoking, disheveled, drooling a bit. He shakes his head to clear it and finds
                Starfire floating into view behind him. She is clutching her forearm.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Well, that was a shock</sp>

            <sd>She turns up her nose and floats on.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Hmph!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>So...I'm guessing you're still mad</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the other three, Cyborg helps Raven to her feet.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Okay, team<sd>Starfire arrives, then Beast Boy.</sd>
                We have to find those guys before they do any more damage. Cyborg, search the west
                side. Raven, the east. I'll take downtown. Beast Boy, you and Star scan from the
                skies.</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy looks uneasily up at the partner who has just been assigned to him. She
                has turned her back and crossed her arms.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Um...maybe Cyborg should come with me
                instead.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Cyborg can't fly.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Oh. Yeah.</sp>

                little clorbag.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to the open courtyard in front of the museum. On either side of a central
                open area is a row of vertical concrete slabs; a large metal globe is mounted at the
                end nearest the building. A couple of fellows make their way across the screen on
                foot and bicycle before there is a mighty blast of lightning. The troublemaking
                brothers appear, scaring the men away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Magnificent<sd>warms up</sd>We can make much
                mischief here!</sp>

            <sd>He strikes the globe, which rolls away from its post toward one row of slabs. It
                bangs into the end one, which topples over into the next, and so on like a row of
                falling dominoes. Long shot of Thunder, whose expression changes to one of
                trepidation as the last slab comes down.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>walks into view</sd>Brother! Did you see what I...something troubles you?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>The green one's words. He says our fun

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>laughs</sd>Wrong<sd>puts his arm across Thunder's shoulders</sd>He speaks
                nonsense, brother! How could such amusement be wrong? The fun is only
                beginning.</sp>

            <sd>He leads his brother away. Dissolve to Starfire in flight, looking intently down
                toward the o.c. Jump City; Beast Boy, as a falcon, glides next to her. Their
                perspective, passing the damaged courtyard of the museum, then cut to ground level
                as they land. Beast Boy returns to human form, and they begin to inspect the smashed
                slabs.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Well, either they were just here, or this is
                the ugliest modern art I've ever seen.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>You are not funny. You are a clorbag
                varblernelk</sp>

            <sd>She walks o.c.; he follows.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Come on, Star<sd>Cut to them; he catches
                    up.</sd>You can't stay mad forever. What? Do I have to do the face
                    <sd>smiling</sd>You know you can't resist the face.</sp>

            <sd>Except for a glance out of the corner of her eye, she has not looked his way
                throughout all of this. In no time flat, he has transformed into a small kitten with
                huge, shining eyes. He meows as endearingly as he can; she looks down at him for a
                long moment.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>turning her nose up</sd>Hmph!</sp>

            <sd>She walks away and he returns to human form with a surprised meow.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>She resisted the face!</sp>

            <sd>She has now reached the point where the globe was anchored. Smoke rises from the
                stump. Beast Boy runs up again.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Just talk to me, Star<sd>kneels</sd>Come on,
                this is no fun!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>from o.c.</sd>Wrong again, green one!</sp>

            <sd>Cut to the stormy sky. Laughing, Thunder floats into view on his cloud and throws a
                beam downward. He is joined by an equally jubilant Lightning, also firing away. The
                camera zooms in on the two off-guard Titans and then pulls back to frame the whole
                courtyard as the brothers' onslaught connects in several places. Starfire runs down
                one side and manages to keep just ahead of Thunder, also on foot; when she reaches
                the end, she goes straight up the wall and does a long, high backflip to come down
                behind him. She throws a starbolt, but misses him.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to Lightning; he gets a bolt ready.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Ha!</sp>

            <sd>He flings it at Beast Boy, who changes into a rabbit and hops away. Lightning chases
                him toward the ruins of those slabs and fires again. The startled green bunny runs
                o.c., and when the camera tilts up to the sky, we see that he has become a crane.
                More lightning comes his way and is just barely dodged; now he drops to the ground
                as a mouse and runs toward Lightning. The projectiles are very easy for him to evade
                now. Close-up of the static-electricity master.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>laughing</sd>Your animal forms cannot protect you forever!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy, as a bighorn sheep, barrels into him and sends him flying. Starfire flips
                and leaps her way to the end of the courtyard as Thunder closes in. He projects a
                beam toward her, she counters with a mighty starbolt, and the two attacks meet
                between them and cancel out. Overhead view of the two duelists; her energy starts to
                overwhelm his. Close-up of him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>The starbolt reaches him and knocks him across the open expanse to land squarely on
                the spot where the globe had stood. Beast Boy, now a giant bear, moves in on him,
                and Lightning takes his fallen brother's place against Starfire. The ursine Titan
                gets to his hind legs and plows into Thunder, driving him to the courtyard wall,
                then runs up in human form and grabs his collar.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I don't want to hurt you. And I don't think
                you want to hurt me.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Pain does not amuse us.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Could've fooled me. Keep playing rough, and
                innocent people will get hurt.</sp>

            <sd>This makes the big blue fellow think a bit. Cut to a fence that separates the
                concrete of the courtyard from the museum lawn. There is a sudden puff of smoke,
                which solidifies into a tall figure wearing long red traveling robes and a broad,
                flat-crowned hat. An arm is lowered from the face, revealing long white hair blowing
                about an old but strong male face. The overall impression is vaguely Oriental, and
                is reinforced by the thin mustache and beard. Only one eye, the left, can be seen.
                Under the red robes, the man wears black ones and has hidden an old wooden box on a
                tripod. This has a hand crank in its side, much like an old-style movie camera.</sd>

            <sd>The sorcerer smiles evilly and begins to turn the crank. The front cover falls away
                to expose a camera lens, which glows red and then white. Beast Boy and Thunder are
                caught off guard as the ground trembles.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy #Thunder">Beast Boy and Thunder</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>A broad energy beam shoots past them from the camera and smashes cleanly through the
                intact row of concrete slabs. It just misses Starfire and Lightning, who have broken
                off their duel; he sidesteps, but she gasps as a shower of ruined stonework comes
                straight down toward her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Star!</sp>

            <sd>The shadows of the crumbling slabs fall over him. Fade to black.</sd>

                <sd>to Thunder</sd>Yes! More fun</sp>

            <sd>Thunder restrains him with a hand on his shoulder.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>What? The green one has poisoned your

            <sd>He walks out of the courtyard; Lightning follows.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Come, brother, and leave your foolish
                thoughts behind.</sp>

            <sd>Thunder takes a few steps after them, but stops and looks back at the pile of
                crumbled stone for a moment. He then turns to catch up with the other two, and the
                camera pans to the wreckage and cuts to a close-up of its surface. A small green
                spider, Beast Boy, scuttles out of a hole in the pile and climbs up the side a bit;
                he then returns to human form.</sd>

            <sd>He strains to lift a good-sized fragment and manages to get it clear of the
                pile.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>softly</sd>...I'm a total clorbag.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to behind him; a tall shadow is thrown across him from near the camera. Pull
                back to frame its source, Starfire, with not so much as a scratch on her. He turns
                around.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Huh?</sp>

            <sd>She gives him a warm, forgiving smile that instantly perks him up.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Starfire!</sp>

            <sd>Taking kitten form again, he jumps into her outstretched hands and she cuddles him
                to her chest. Her perspective; he looks up at her and meows happily.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>
                <sd>laughing</sd>I am glad you are unharmed as well</sp>

            <sd>Pull back from both; he takes human form and kneels before her.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>I am so sorry. You gotta forgive me.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to a clearing in the mountains outside Jump City. A few scarecrow-like
                dummies have been set up, consisting of two crossed tree limbs with a blanket
                wrapped around them. Some characters have been painted on the cloth. Pan across the
                area; more such dummies have been set up, and the sorcerer stands among them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Are you certain, young master? Try. You may
                like what you see.</sp>

            <sd>The young master in question groans and throws a bolt at one of the dummies; it
                instantly catches fire and makes him rethink his opinion of the whole exercise.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Dancing lights! Pleasing.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Let Thunder try his hand.</sp>

            <sd>He steps toward a target and throws a blast, causing the thing to disappear in a
                small explosion and a great clap of sound.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Wondrous noise!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>See, brother? There is no harm in our

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>And there is so much fun to be had.</sp>

            <sd>The two thrill-seekers grin at each other. Lightning flies across the clearing,
                blasting one target after another, and Thunder leaps high and slams a fist against
                the ground to open a furrow. A target at the end of it lights up, followed by
                several others when he redirects his efforts. Now both brothers work in tandem and
                turn one target after another into blazing torches. They finally stop their assault
                and back up to the sorcerer.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>More targets, old one!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Yes, please, give us more.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>That won't be necessary. You've done quite
                enough.</sp>

            <sd>He produces a metal disc from underneath his robes. Close-up: it bears a character,
                Chinese in appearance, that looks something like a stylized letter S. Pull back; he
                scales the object over the clearing as Thunder and Lightning watch, totally baffled.
                It stops high in the sky and spins in place; electricity crackles around it as it
                picks up speed, culminating in a mighty orange flash. Pull back to show it suspended
                over the burning target as rays of light shoot down to strike every last one. Beams
                of orange light start to play between them and just miss the two puzzled
                brothers.</sd>

            <sd>Pull back to a long overhead shot to reveal that these have traced out a large,
                rough humanoid shape on the ground, with a final wide beam from above touching the
                heart area. When the light show stops, the outline starts to burn intensely; the
                sorcerer holds up a staff topped with the same character that was on the disc he
                threw.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Rise.</sp>

            <sd>The apparition does so with an unearthly screeching noise. It has that character
                engraved on its forehead.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Burn, Fire! Burn it all!</sp>

            <sd>It starts down the mountainside toward the city proper, but stops upon finding the
                Titans some distance away.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Didn't anyone ever tell you<sd>Cut to them.</sd> Play
                with fire, you're going to get burned.</sp>

            <sd>The beast swings a flaming forearm at the team, forcing them to scatter. Robin looks
                up from the duck-and-cover position he has assumed and sees Fire pushing trees aside
                and making its way toward Jump City. Smoke and flames billow in its wake as the
                camera pans slightly to put the entire metro area in view, and right in its path.
                The sorcerer waves the fumes aside with his staff.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Good. Very good.</sp>

            <sd>Thunder and Lightning cannot believe what they have just had a hand in
                unleashing.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Brother, what have we done?</sp>

            <sd>The thing continues down the mountain. Fade to black.</sd>

        </act>
        <act n="3">
            <title>Act Three</title>
            <sd>Opening shot: a group of houses built downhill of the newly kindled forest. Tilt up
                to show the extent of the blazes, then cut to Fire as it stalks on toward the city.
                The Titans chase it.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Titans! Go!</sp>

            <sd>He pulls even with the creature on foot while Raven does likewise in the air.
                Pulling a couple of grenades from his belt, he throws them at its feet; they throw
                up a wall of smoke when they blow. Raven flies through it all.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Flames can't spread if there's nothing to burn.
                Azarath Metrion Zinthos</sp>

            <sd>Her spell uproots several trees.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Good idea, Raven. Beast Boy! Starfire! Help her
                out!</sp>

            <sd>These two put on a burst of speed, and Beast Boy turns into a buffalo to deliver a
                crushing headbutt against the base of a tree. It topples into a row of others and
                brings them all down. Meanwhile, Starfire takes up a position high above the boughs;
                she throws a starbolt that blows another clump of old growth to matchwood. His
                cannon at the ready, Cyborg leaps toward Fire and lets go with a terrific blast when
                he lands. It skims the ground and throws up a wall of dirt in the beast's face; a
                large-scale equivalent of dumping sand on a campfire to put it out.</sd>

            <sd>It takes some time for the view to begin to clear. Fire is nowhere in sight among
                the dust clouds. Cut to the Titans; Beast Boy is in human form again.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Is he out?</sp>

            <sd>Pull back to frame him in front of the murky air. In answer to his question, Fire
                stands up, still blazing and now roaring mad.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>You had to ask.</sp>

            <sd>As it screeches some more, Robin runs up for a closer look. Cut to his perspective
                of the flaming creature and zoom in a bit. Up the slope to one side, standing on a
                stone outcropping, is the sorcerer. Close-up: he grins maliciously. Back to Robin,
                who is starting to put it all together, then to the old man. Thunder and Lightning
                are behind him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Go, young masters. Fire is your creation. They
                have no right to destroy your fun.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Yes! We must fight!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>But, brother--</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>Do not annoy me with your foolish concerns!
                Come!</sp>

            <sd>The blue brother thinks it over for a moment, and both of them disappear in a flash
                of light. The sorcerer turns away from the spot where they stood and spreads his
                arms; he starts to laugh in triumph, but it dies on his lips as Robin's yell is
                heard from o.c. The Titans' leader sails across the clearing and lands a flying kick
                that sends the staff spiraling through the air. It sticks in the ground, walking end
                down, and Robin lands next to it. However, the thing pulls loose and sails back into
                the old man's hand.</sd>

            <sd>The tense seconds pass as the two face off; finally the sorcerer breaks the silence,
                his voice starting to take on a tone similar to that used by Slade.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Robin. We meet at last.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Who are you?</sp>

            <sd>There is no answer, except for a charge with staff raised for a swing. Robin meets
                it by hurling himself at the enemy as Fire moves closer to the city. Cut to Raven in
                flight.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</sp>

            <sd>This time, she has targeted the creature itself. The stream of black energy pouring
                from her hands breaks against the giant's form and stops it in its tracks. When she
                relents, its flames have gone out, leaving the body black and smoking. Cut to the
                midsection and tilt up to the head as the surface begins to crack all over; finally,
                the creature lights up again and Raven gasps in shock. It slams its fists together
                and creates a pyrotechnic shock wave that blasts away all the trees within several
                dozen yards. She is thrown back by the overpressure, as is Cyborg.</sd>

            <sd>Ground level: he slams down, and Starfire and Raven land and start to help him up.
                Before they can get him upright, though, a lightning bolt flashes down and knocks
                all three even farther away. The brothers descend to the clearing; Lightning warms
                up his hands and advances, while Thunder stays put and gets ready to attack. Before
                he can throw that curveball, though, Beast Boy, as a tiger, steps into view before
                him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Stand aside, green one!</sp>

            <sd>Said green one just roars. They charge at one another, but before any blows can
                land, violet smoke boils up and covers the entire screen. When it clears, we are in
                the middle of a bank of clouds in this color. Thunder is among them, but his body is
                largely in shadow and drawn in a somewhat different style now. The next cut, after
                the following line, will show Beast Boy in a similar manner. The entire view
                shimmers and wavers somewhat, and the two voices echo slightly.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>I do not wish to harm you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>But you want to destroy homes and innocent
                lives?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>No.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Then what are you fighting for?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>My brother and I...the old one says we are
                unique, gifted, better.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Gifts don't make you better, just different.
                It's how you use them that counts.</sp>

            <sd>Thunder turns this over in his mind a bit. Cut to a close-up of Lightning.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>It seems your power has its limit<sd>holds up
                    a sparking hand</sd>But mine has none.</sp>

            <sd>Pull back. He is standing over the unconscious Starfire and getting ready to light
                her up like a Christmas tree, but before he can do so, a blast from Thunder plows
                him away. She comes to and looks in the direction of the shot; shift to frame both
                brothers. Thunder pushes over a charred tree as he steps up, and Lightning gets to
                his feet.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>warms up</sd>You betray me?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>We have done wrong, my brother. Our fun must
                stop.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>No one commands Lightning..<sd>warming
                    up</sd>...not even Thunder!</sp>

            <sd>He throws a wide beam; the impact sends Thunder tumbling among the trees. Robin and
                the sorcerer, meanwhile, continue their melee as the mountain burns all around them.
                Slowly but steadily, the young Titan retreats downhill before his attacker's swings.
                Soon, though, he holds his ground and blocks one strike after another, then
                sidesteps when the upper end of the staff is jabbed at him. It hits a tree and sends
                up a wisp of smoke as if it were a red-hot branding iron. The sorcerer grimaces down
                at him.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to the mountainside. Fire continues its inexorable advance toward the lower
                houses as the other four Titans gather to watch. Beast Boy is back in human
                form.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Those houses go, the whole city could go. We gotta
                stop the fire!</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>How?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Any way we can.</sp>

            <sd>They run down the slope. Cut to Lightning in flight; he throws a bolt out ahead, and
                the camera shifts to Thunder, whose face suddenly goes slack-realizing he is the
                target. The electricity washes over him and hurls him back against a wall of rock.
                He slides down to a sitting position and groans wearily. Looking up, he finds his
                brother standing over him and ready to unload a king-size shock at point-blank
                range.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>Tell me, brother, are we still having fun</sp>

            <sd>Lightning's conscience gets to him.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>
                <sd>winding down</sd>No.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>
                <sd>pointing</sd>Observe.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to behind Fire as it descends the mountain, then to in front of it and tilt down
                to the houses. It is hit in the face with a sudden torrent of water, accompanied by
                an elephant's trumpeting. Pan along a street; Raven is casting a spell to hold the
                flames back, Beast Boy, as the pachyderm, is spraying water from his trunk, and
                Cyborg has opened a fire hydrant. Starfire descends among them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>They also have gifts, but they use them for good,
                while we waste ours on dangerous fun<sd>He puts a hand on Lightning's
                shoulder.</sd>If we are so special, brother, let us act special. We must help.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>But how? Our gifts can only destroy.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>True. But together we have another gift.</sp>

            <sd>They are gone in a flash of light, ascending into the cloud cover. When they have
                vanished from sight, a blast of lightning is seen from within. The four Titans find
                themselves staring at a mountain in flames and a walking inferno that has not let up
                one bit despite their best efforts. It towers over them and roars.</sd>

            <sd>Cut to the clouds, as seen at the beginning of the episode. Thunder strikes them
                with his sticks and Lightning directs his hands here and there, producing the same
                effects as before. The camera shifts to point up at them from foot level as the
                glare plays over both of them and a driving rain begins; the result of combining
                their talents. At ground level, Fire looks up in alarm at the downpour, then screams
                in agony as its flames go out in a thick wall of brown smoke. When the view clears,
                there is nothing left but a few piles of ashes. Pan from them to Beast Boy, Cyborg,
                Raven, and Starfire. All but Raven cheer wildly; Beast Boy is in human form.</sd>

            <sd>Up on the mountain, the sorcerer has caught the front of Robin's tunic and hoisted
                him up. The former's tone of voice is now unmistakable.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</spkr>Robin. Is that the best you can do?</sp>

            <sd>There is a tremendous flash of lightning that whites out the entire screen. When it
                subsides, the view is at ground level; Robin drops into a crouch, free of the man's
                grasp. Cut to the robed figure, who has thrown up an arm to guard his face; he
                brings it down after a moment, revealing it to have been only a mask that was
                damaged in the strike. Most of the left side has fallen away, and underneath is a
                smooth expanse of red-orange metal with a narrow slit for the eye. The last
                remaining pieces come loose to fully expose that half of Slade's still-concealed
                face; the first time that any of it has been seen on camera. The colored reflection
                in that part of his silhouette, seen in "Divide and Conquer" and "Final Exam," is
                now fully explained, and he was able to recognize Robin from Gizmo's transmission at
                the end of "Final Exam."</sd>

            <sd>Robin gasps in shock and stares, frozen in place, and after a long moment, the
                mastermind disappears in a blast of smoke that fills the screen. The view clears to
                show a close-up of the metal disc he threw into the air to bring Fire to life. Pull
                back; Robin regards it thoughtfully, then picks it up for a very close look.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>Slade.</sp>

            <sd>Dissolve to the street, where the celebration is still going on. Beast Boy has his
                tongue out to catch the raindrops.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Ah, yeah</sp>

            <sd>He laughs.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's what I mean! Very nice!</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy turns away from the street and sees Thunder and Lightning coming down from
                the mountain. He crosses to them. Lightning looks away, showing very clearly that he
                would rather be doing anything else right now.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>
                <sd>bows</sd>I am sorry for the trouble we have made</sp>

            <sd>He nudges Lightning, who faces forward.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Lightning">Lightning</spkr>I am..<sd>also bows</sd>...also sorry</sp>

            <sd>Thunder and Beast Boy shake hands.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Thunder">Thunder</spkr>You have taught us much, green one. Thank
                you.</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Don't thank me<sd>He gestures at Starfire; she
                    steps forward.</sd>Thank the person who taught me</sp>

            <sd>She and the brothers bow to each other.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>And thank you for helping to defeat the flame
                monster.</sp>

            <sd>Cut to an overhead view of the six; two brothers and four Titans, and then dissolve
                to a long shot of the Tower, seen from the city proper. It is now sunrise of the
                next day, the clouds have broken, and a rainbow stretches up from the horizon behind
                the Tower. Pan a short distance to the entire team, on a ridge overlooking Jump
                City. Robin hands Slade's talisman to Cyborg so he can give it a looking over.</sd>

            <cue>Animation goofs: Starfire's armband appears and disappears during this final scene,
                and the black stones in her wrist guards turn red.</cue>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>So, Slade wants to destroy the city. Question is,
                why?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>I don't know, but I will find out, and he won't get
                away with it</sp>

            <sd>Beast Boy comes up behind Starfire.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>So...am I, you know...still a clorbag?</sp>

            <sp><spkr ref="#Starfire">Starfire</spkr>Mmm, no. I believe you are more of a...milnip
                wusserloop.</sp>

            <sd>Not being too fluent in Tamaranean, he does not know what to make of this label for
                a moment. Bewilderment quickly gives way to a big grin, though.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>SWEET<sd>dances</sd>Go, Beast Boy! I'm a
                milnip! Who's your wusserloop? Huh?</sp>

            <sd>He stops dancing; for a moment his eyes have stars in them.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>
                <sd>a bit puzzled</sd>That is a good thing...right, Star?</sp>

            <sd>She just giggles and goes airborne to head home. Raven follows her, while Robin and
                Cyborg start running. The green Titan is left standing by himself.</sd>

            <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>Star?</sp>

            <sd>He hot-foots it after the others. Fade to black.</sd>
