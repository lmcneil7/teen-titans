            <title>The fate of the Storm Twins, Thunder and Lightning, is looking grim. Dr. Klyburn isn't sure on how to heal them. Dr. Klyburn senses a power power surge and realizes that the brothers are draining the Laser Banks. The problem is they can't handle that much energy; Starfire and Cyborg focus on removing them. However, an explosion occurs and they fail to remove them. The twins are awake, but they're having internal conflict as seen from before. Regardless, they fight the Titans and cause a lot of damage. Both sides are trying to avoid fighting and Raven decides to use her powers to find a solution.</title>
