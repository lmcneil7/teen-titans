            <p>The scene starts where we left off: Thunder and Lightning attacking the U.S. Army. The T-Jet lands and the Titans rush out to see what's going on. Koriand'r goes to apprehend Thunder and Lightning, but Lightning attacks. They reveal that they're looking for Second Lieutenant Walter Williams. Wonder Girl feels like they don't want to fight; however, the Titans have no choice but to attack. The Titans win the battle and decide to ask the brothers questions. They reveal why they're looking for Lieutenant Williams through flashback. They find out his last location was Maige and take off before anyone could stop them.</p>
