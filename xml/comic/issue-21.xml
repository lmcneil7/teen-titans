            <p>Thinking there's a bomb, Koriand'r and Raven go to a baseball game to find it and stop it; however, it's a ploy by the villian to kill them. He first tries to shoot Raven from a distance, but she senses it first and dodges it. Raven finds the location, third base, and Koriand'r rushes the bomb into space for the impending explosion. She throws it a bit too late and goes into shock due to the explosion. Raven, as an empath, can help her by taking her pain.</p>

            <p>The Titans change and then are taken to a ceremony. Brother Blood calls out sinners and asks for them to repent. He kills Wendy Fletcher for confessing she doesn't believe in him anymore. Feeling her pain, Raven reacts and Brother Blood orders his believers to attack, their cover offically blown. They start to fight back with Kid Flash heading for Blood. He doesn't get far as he gets electrocuted. He reveals that he has followers in all parts of the world and places of power(government, universities,etc.). He shots Robin, causing him to collapse. Wonder Girl attacks next. She doesn't fend off well and ends up in the same state as Robin and Kid Flash. Raven, sensing she will lose, tries to retrieve the other Titans and escape; however, Blood stops her. Now all Titans are been defeated.</p>
