*Current Semester: Spring 2020*

**Fall 2019**

This is a repository to create an interactive comic of the 2003 cartoon network tv series *Teen Titans* with a comparison between the tv series and the comics that *Teen Titans* is based off.

**XML:**
For our XML markup, we're doing transcripts of the episodes of *Teen Titans*, the 2003 tv show created by Cartoon Network. For this semester, we decided to stick with Season 1 that includes thirteen episodes in total. You'll find the XML documents in the XML file in the "season-1" folder.

We did metadata for the comics; we limited to the issues that had anything to do with the television series instead of doing the entire volume. At the moment, only the issues that connected to episodes in season 1 are the ones on our website.

*Episodes* (https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/Teen_Titans)

*Here's a website to read the comics:* https://readcomiconline.to/Comic/The-New-Teen-Titans-1980.

**Other:**

*SVG:* Courtesy of Shannon, we created graphs to compare how many times each Teen Titan (Robin, Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, Beastboy) spoke in each episode.

*Methodology:* Suggested to do us by our instructor, the methodology is a way to show how we created our website through each of the different steps along the way. It's in the ___work of process___ phase at the moment to accommodate for the fandom aspect of our project! Will constantly be udpating since we're doing another semester of work.

**Spring 2020**

We gained a new member. **Welcome Amber!**

We're continuing this project for the next DH course! While it's still a repository to compare the television show and the comics, the focus will be different to fit the purpose of the spring course. 

Research question: **TBD**

**XML:**
Similar to the fall semester, we're working on the transcripts of the episodes of *Teen Titans*. For this semester, we will be doing season 2 of the series.

```**WILL ADD MORE AS THE SEMESTER CONTINUES**```
