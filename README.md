Welcome dudes to the Teen Titans Project!

*Current Semester: Spring 2020*

**Fall 2019**

This is a repository to create an interactive comic of the 2003 cartoon network tv series *Teen Titans* with a comparison between the tv series and the comics that *Teen Titans* is based off.

**XML:**
For our XML markup, we're doing transcripts of the episodes of *Teen Titans*, the 2003 tv show created by Cartoon Network. For this semester, we decided to stick with Season 1 that includes thirteen episodes in total. You'll find the XML documents in the XML file in the "season-1" folder.

Here's a website to read the comics: https://readcomiconline.to/Comic/The-New-Teen-Titans-1980.
