Welcome dudes to the Teen Titans Project!
This is a repository to create an interactive comic of the 2003 cartoon network tv series *Teen Titans* with a comparison between the tv series and the comics that *Teen Titans* is based off.

**XML:**
For our XML markup, we're doing transcripts of the episodes of *Teen Titans*, the 2003 tv show created by Cartoon Network. For this semester, we decided to stick with Season 1 that includes thirteen episodes in total. You'll find the XML documents in the XML file in the season 1 folder. We set up the directory like this for any circumstances in which we decide to continue the project.

*Episodes*
- Episode 1: Divide and Conquer
- Episode 2: Sisters
- Episode 3: Final Exam
- Episode 4: Forces of Nature
- Episode 5: The Sum of His Parts
- Episode 6: Nevermore
- Episode 7: Switched
- Episode 8: Deep Six
- Episode 9: Masks
- Episode 10: Mad Mod
- Episode 11: Car Trouble
- Episode 12: Appretince - Part 1
- Episode 13: Apprentice - Part 2
